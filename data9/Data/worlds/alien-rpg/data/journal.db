Without the resources on the Outer Rim to handle the threat, the Three World Empire requested assistance from the United Americas Allied Command. Eager to help in exchange for new tariff and export treaties, the United Americas sent in the marines. Because the Colonial Marines considered the rebel raids little more than a nuisance, the rebelling colonists were nicknamed “Bug-Boys.” <br />The situation changed when the Bug-Boys started using sophisticated weapons from an unidentified source—either a corporate or political enemy of the Three World Empire—and managed to cripple the USCMC frigate USS Sulaco with an orbital strike. The USCMC retaliated in kind, bringing in ships, marines, heavy equipment and tanks to retake the planet. The Bug-Boys were squashed, and the USCMC has maintained an occupying peace force on Linna 349 ever since, despite requests from the Three World Empire to release the world.

EVENTS - ACT III","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">ACT III: DIVIDED WE FALL</h1>\n<p>In the final Act of the scenario, the PCs need to fight for their lives in the derelict ship, facing off against the corporate agents, Lucas, and the infected crew members, without knowing who is on their side and who is transforming into an Abomination. <br /><br />In this Act, the Personal Agendas of the PCs play out in full — especially for Lucas and Wilson — and what happens is largely determined by the players themselves. <br /><br />Here are some suggested events however:</p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">GOING HOME</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thanks to the work of the PCs and/or NPCs, the engines of the <em>Cronus</em> come back online. <br />As soon as this happens, MU/TH/UR 2000 locks the ship on a course for Earth. A <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll reveals that the mainframe is under Special Order 966 to return the USCSS Cronus to Earth. <br /><br />No PC can override this order.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MEDICINAL PURPOSES</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Clayton asks the PCs to help bring the strain samples to Earth, explaining that this “primeval” Xeno­morph material is priceless, invaluable for research into cancer and a host of other serious diseases. <br /><br />And even if the 26 Draconis Strain cure is unstable, if it could be perfected, anyone encountering the spores would be safe. According to the translations the science team made, these creatures are not native to LV-1113 — they could be spread over countless worlds. </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MUTINY!</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>If the PCs resist Clayton and want to destroy the 26 Draconis Strain samples or even the <em>Cronus</em> itself, Clayton tries to bribe or persuade crew members to come to her side — especially Wilson, if he’s still alive — causing a mutiny among the survivors. <br /><br />Clayton uses <strong>MANIPULATION</strong> to have her way, using whatever leverage she can Clayton wants to accomplish a few things. She wants to get the 26 Draconis Strain syringes from the Medlab; get cash from the safe in her suite to bribe the crew with; retrieve her MCD cube, also in the safe; finally, she wants to load as many containers of Agent A0-3959X.91–15 as she can into her quarters using the EEV as an insurance policy. <br /><br />Clayton sends Wilson, or whomever else she’s cajoled to her side, to accomplish this. If none of this is possible, she at least wants one inoculation syringe full of the 26 Draconis Strain and an urn or vial from the Medlab or Science Labs so as to have something to return with. <br /><br />If things go bad, Clayton tries to kidnap Dr. Flynn and escape with as much as possible on the EEV.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">THE INFECTION SPREADS</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>While the PCs struggle with how to react to Clayton, more PCs are affected by the 26 Draconis Strain inoculation, turning more and more players into antagonists possibly until only a single unturned PC remains.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">PREPARE TO BE BOARDED</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A heavy clang against the hull tells the PCs that another ship has made contact and docked with the <em>Cronus</em>. <br />A system check confirms this. <br /><br />This is in fact the corporate-sponsored marauder ship <em>Sotillo</em>, whose signature might have been picked up earlier by the <em>Montero</em> or the <em>Cronus</em>. <br /><br />The <em>Sotillo’s</em> crew hung back for most of the scenario to see what’s going on; now they have chosen to board the <em>Cronus</em> and take her cargo, blasting their way through the airlock. They don’t wear compression suits, and they soon find out they got themselves into more than they bargained for. <br />If PCs have been killed or turned into Abominations, players can take over marauder characters to stay in the game. <br /><br />The crew of the <em>Sotillo</em> are described in <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[05. NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS]</span>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">WHO’S ON WHOSE SIDE NOW?</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>While Clayton tries to bribe the marauders into helping them, they aren’t too excited about the idea of these creatures getting loose on the Frontier. <br />Captain Bolaji weighs risk vs. a hefty paycheck before deciding whether to take Clayton, Wilson, and any xeno­morphic materials aboard the <em>Sotillo</em> or simply cut and run.<br />It’s unlikely the other PCs can convince the captain to rescue them, as they have no bargaining chip, but it might be possible for them to board the <em>Sotillo</em> and take it for themselves. <br />Inadvertently, the marauders' presence gives the PCs a fighting chance to survive, and their ship is the way out of this. <br />The Sotillo crew can of course be infected by Neomorphic Motes on the Cronus, and/or turn into Abominations if they take the inoculation.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CONTAMINATION PROTOCOL</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>In Act III, Lucas’s Personal Agenda is to use any means to stop Weyland-Yutani from getting their hands on the 26 Draconis Strain — meaning a direct confrontation between Lucas and Clayton is very likely. <br />Lucas might even try to sabotage or destroy the <em>Cronus</em> (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[C. CARGO DECK]</span> for information on how that can be done). <br />If the other PCs destroy Lucas’s physical body, he ceases to be a PC and turns into an NPC. He uploads himself to the mainframe of the <em>Cronus</em> and triggers a reactor overload. He freezes the locks on Clayton’s EEV. If the <em>Sotillo</em> has been introduced, the PCs' best choice may be to take the ship. It takes some work to release the locks on the EEV (a Turn of work and a <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>Note:</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">Only add the <em>Sotillo</em> to the mix if you feel the need for another twist in the story, want to make the scenario longer, or really need replacement PCs.

The Cronus grows smaller and smaller in the distance. <br />The safety harnesses cut into your waist and shoulders, and you can’t even catch your breath. <br />Just before you black out, there is a flash of light where the Cronus used to be, followed by a tornado in space. <br />Your eyes are seared shut by a shockwave of white and you are rocked violently as gamma rays assault you. <br />You try to open your eyes, but all you can see is blues, purples, and oranges blasting through space. After a minute, you realize you are alive. <br /><br />You remember to breathe. <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>It’s going to be okay.</em></h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">IT ISN’T OVER UNTIL IT’S OVER</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>If the PCs escaped on the <em>Sotillo</em>, it’s possible that one or more Stage III or Stage IV Abominations have climbed aboard her hull before the PCs took off. <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>If so, it isn’t over yet.</em></h3>\n<br />Have the surviving player(s) sigh in relief, and rest long enough to relieve their Stress Level. <br />As their adrenaline rush subsides, they begin prepping the displacement drive for FTL speeds. <br />They gaze out at the stars, and two fists slam hard against the viewport. <br /><br />Instead of the cosmos, they stare into the eyes of a monster. <br />One of the Abominations is trying to smash through the cockpit viewport. <br />While it isn’t strong enough to, the PCs don’t know that—and the beast can damage it. <br />Again and again the rage-filled monstrosity crashes its bulbous fists into the reverberating viewport. <br />With the fourth blow, the window catches the glint of a faraway star as a hairline crack begins to splinter across its surface. <br /><br /><strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong> +1 for all PCs inside. <br /><br />If the PCs activate the viewport shields, there is a good chance they maim or kill one of the Abominations in the process (it gets its head or limb stuck between the closing metal sheets). <br />If the PCs don’t get all the remaining Abominations off the hull, the creatures damage the <em>Sotillo</em> and she ends up adrift as well. </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","folder":"RvXrz6xgpieLnxg1","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"fCde8VnP1HhwBpwe":3,"3SlHgCFcwdscgES2":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.tOJFoTdyrUWXEmEk"}}}

If in doubt, try it out. <br />Examples are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right click an edit button to choose delete / edit</li>\n<li>Right click to clear radio buttons</li>\n<li>Right click a “roll” to enter modifiers before a roll</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Actors</h1>\n<p>There are three main types of Actors available in the system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Characters</li>\n<li>Synthetics</li>\n<li>Creatures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this section I will go over the common areas of the Character and Synthetic sheets.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Characters</h2>\n <span class=\"character-sheet-img\"> </span> \n<h2 class=\"headng\">General Tab</h2>\n<br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Header (1)</h3>\n <span class=\"character-header\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Health is not automatically calculated so needs to be updated manually as per the rules. <br /><br />For the GM, an NPC tick box is visible which changes the Token settings for the actor (see Tokens section).</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Details (2)</h3>\n<p>In the Career dropdown you can select the appropriate career for the PC. <br />Any specialities that have been dragged on to the character sheet will show under the Career dropdown. <br />These can be displayed and edited in the same way as Talents on the Skills tab. <br />The details boxes are text fields to record short details about the PC's.</p>\n <span class=\"character-details\"> </span> \n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Tracking (3)</h3>\n<p>The left sidebar enables the player to track Experience, Radiation, Conditions, Consumables and Armor.</p>\n<br /> <span class=\"character-consumables\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Experience, Story Points, Radiation and Conditions are radio buttons. Left mouse click to set and Right mouse click to unset. <br /><br />Adding Radiation will cause a roll to determine if there is any health damage caused by the radiation. <br /><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If there is it must be applied manually I did not automate this in case there are any cures to be applied. <br /> <span class=\"radiation-roll\"> </span>  <br />Overwatch is a (left click) toggle and gives an \"Eye\" status icon on the token so show the actor is in Overwatch. <br /><br />If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show for any conditions set:</p>\n<br /> <span class=\"status-icons-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Right clicking on the condition will remove the status icon. <br /><strong> NOTE:</strong> <em>Removing the status icon from the token HUD will not remove the condition on the actor sheet. </em> <br /><br />The \"Panicked\" condition will automatically set following panic rolls of 7+. This triggers the \"More Panic\" mechanics in the system. To remove the Panicked condition right click on “PANICKED”. This will reset the PC's panic level to 0. When active it will also display the “Panic Level” to the player to show how near breaking they are. <br /><br /><strong> NOTE:</strong> <em>This does not affect their Stress level.</em> <br /><br />The consumables and Armor values are updated automatically based on the \"Active\" items in the PC's Inventory (See Inventory for more details.)</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Consumables</h3>\n<p>In the system all the items \"Active\" consumable values are combined to give these totals. All supply rolls will rolla maximum of 6 supply dice as per the rules. <br /><br />For Air, Food and Water just click on the Parachute icon to make a supply roll. Failures are removed from the value of the corresponding items in the PCs Inventory in the order they were added. <br /><br />Power supply rolls are made against the individual items on the Inventory tab by clicking on the value in the Pwr column. <br />This will roll the total number of power dice (to a maximum of 6) but on a failure (Facehugger) will only deduct from the item the power roll is made for. <br /><br />This is a near as I can get to the actual rules which are a little vague when it comes to Power supply rolls.  <span class=\"pwr-supply\"> </span>  <br />Once the power level is zero it will no longer roll and the player will need to edit the item in order to change the power level.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Armor</h3>\n<p>Clicking on Armor will roll the combined value of any active armor (total shown in the box). <br />Right clicking will display a modifier box with one-click options for \"Armor Piercing\" (half armor value) and \"Armor Doubled\" (2 x armor value). <br /><br />Additionally, right or left clicking on the name of armor on the Inventory tab will also perform an Armor roll or show a modification chat box.</p>\n<br /> <span class=\"armor-mod\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Critical Injuries (4)</h2>\n<p>Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button. This looks for a table named \"Critical injuries\" for Characters. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br />Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted. <br /><br />If you have the Core Rules or Starter Set modules enabled when on rolling a Critical Injury for a PC or Synthetic the Critical Injury item will be automatically created and added to the actors sheet. <br />You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br /><br />Right clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button will display a dialogue box allowing the player/GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in D66 format (number 11 to 16, 21 to 26 etc.) for Characters and D6 format for Synthetics (1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br /><br /><br />Using the Item type \"critical-injury\" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Skills Tab (5)</h2>\n<p>The Skills tab lists the skills available to players. These are updated by the player during character creation. <br /> <span class=\"moskills\"> </span>  <br />Left mouse click will roll the value, taking into account current stress dice. <br />A Right mouse click will display a modifier dialogue box allowing you to add or subtract Base and Stress dice to the roll. <br />For instance, having the Field Surgeon Talent gives a +2 modification to Medical Aid, so you would add 2 to the base dice in the modifier box. <br /><br />Skill rolls are combined with the associated attribute values and Stress dice when making rolls. <br /><br />Clicking on the spanner icon <span class=\"spanner-icon\"> </span> next to a skill will display the appropriate stunts for that skill at the bottom of the sheet, a second click hides the description. (See Skill Stunts below). <br /><br /> <span class=\"talent-agenda\"> </span>  <br />The Talents and Agenda/Story Cards sections allow the player/GM to drop talent and agenda items (see below) onto the characters sheet. Clicking on the item’s name will display the items description at the bottom of the sheet. A second click hides the description. <br /><br />Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing the PCs version of the item to be edited or deleted.  <span class=\"con-edit\"> </span> </p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Inventory Tab (6)</h2>\n<p>At the top of the tab is the Encumbrance meter. This shows the \"Total Carried / Maximum Encumbrance\" where Maximum Encumbrance is Str *4. The two arrows on the Encumbrance show the point at which the PC should be taking penalties for being over encumbered. <br /> <span class=\"enc\"> </span>  <br />When the carried items exceed this point the bar will turn red and flash.</p>\n <span class=\"enc-warn\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />\n<p>If the player has an <strong>active</strong> token in the scene a status icon will show:</p>\n<br /><br /> <span class=\"enc-icon-img\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<p>Reducing the items Active or Inactive items will remove the status icon. <br /><br />The Inventory tab is divided into four sections:</p>\n <span class=\"inventory-tab-img\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<p>Items are dragged on to the sheet from item folders or Compendiums and by default, they will appear on the sheet as Inactive. <br /><br />Inactive items can be considered as being in a backpack/pocket/slung and do not contribute to Consumables, but they do contribute to Encumbrance. <br /><br />The Foot Locker section is for gear owned but stored elsewhere (locker/room etc.) to put an item in the Foot Locker right click on the edit icon to bring up the context menu and select \"Add to Locker\".</p>\n<br /> <span class=\"inv-context-menu-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Items in the Foot Locker are not counted against Encumbrance. <br /><br />To remove items from the Foot Locker, left or right click on the item's icon which will move it to the Active or Inactive section. <br />You can also select \"Take From Locker\" in the context menu which will move the item to \"Inactive\". <br /><br />For any other items or notes use the \"Ad Hoc\" text area at the bottom of the sheet. The Quick-Insert module can be used to create a link (see Recommended Add-on Modules). <br /><br />Weapons cannot be fired when Inactive or in the Foot Locker.</p>\n<br /> <span class=\"inv-inact\"> </span>  <br />\n<p>Left clicking on the items image (1) will Activate the item. When Active right clicking on the item image will make it Inactive. Only Active weapons can be clicked on for rolls. <br /><br />Left clicking on an items edit icon (2) will open the item in edit mode. Right clicking on the edit icon (2) which will display a context menu with edit/delete options.</p>\n<br />  <span class=\"inv-context-menu-img\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<p>Some items have inline edit boxes (3) which enable you to edit some quantities (Rounds, Food, Water, Air, Quantity) without the need to open the item. <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> All Items can be dropped on to the macro bar (though only Weapons will trigger a roll). When using inline edit click on the number in the box, delete or backspace then enter the new number. Trying to highlight the number to edit will drag the entire item.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Synthetics</h2>\n<p>If a player is using a \"Secret Android\" they should use the Character sheet and roleplay as a normal PC just ignoring any Stress Radiation or Condition effects. The GM can easily create a Character and Synthetic sheet for the player, this will enable them to keep up the pretence that they are a normal PC until the big reveal, at which point they can switch to the Synthetic sheet at the appropriate time. <br />Otherwise, they should use the Synthetic sheet which dispenses with any stats, conditions etc that do not affect them. <br /><br />If you do want to use the Synthetic sheet the player can make fake Stress and Push rolls by checking the \"Imitate Human Panic and Push Button\". <br />This enables them to press the \"No Stress\" button to make fake Stress rolls (they will never get over 6). <br />Additionally on normal rolls the chat will display the Push button so will be displayed (it does nothing) so to other players as a normal player and they will need to find a suitable excuse not to push the roll.  <span class=\"synth-hum\"> </span>  <br /><br />Much of the Synthetic sheet is the same as the normal Character sheet so here I will outline the major differences.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Header (1)</h3>\n <span class=\"synthetic-header\"> </span>  <br />As Synthetics do not suffer from Stress that is omitted from their sheet. <br />If the player is using the Synthetic sheet as a “Secret Android” the can click on “No Stress” to make a stress roll. This will always be a 1d6 roll so always shows as “Keeping it Together”. <br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Details (2)</h3>\nThe main section of the General tab has the same fields as the Character sheet except for Signature Item as per the rules Synthetics do not have them. <br />Critical Injury items dragged on to the sheet will be displayed in Critical Injuries section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item. Players can roll their own Critical Hits by clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button. This looks for a table named \"Critical Injuries on Synthetics\" for Androids. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br /><br /> <span class=\"synthetic-details\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Tracking (3)</h3>\nSynthetics do not suffer from Radiation or Conditions, so these are omitted from the left sidebar. <br /><br />While the rules state they do not have consumables, I have left Power for them as I am sure they use items that consume power which should be tracked. <br /> <span class=\"synthetic-consumables\"> </span>  <br />The Skills and Inventory tabs operate the same as for a Character sheet <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Creature Sheets</h2>\n <span class=\"creature-sheet-img\"> </span>  <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Header (1)</h3>\n <span class=\"creature-header\"> </span>  <br />When creating a Creature, the Health is represented as [current health]/[total health], i.e. 6/6. When the creature is injured the [current health] value should be manually reduced. These values are used in the token health bar for the creatures (See Tokens). <br /><br />By default, values are not entered for Mobility, Observation and Acid Splash as not all creatures have these abilities. <br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Attack Table (2)</h3>\nClicking on the Attack Table drop down will show a list of any attack tables that you have created in the \"Alien Tables&gt; Alien Creature Tables\" folder. Once selected the table can be rolled against by clicking on the \"Roll Attack\" button. <br /> <span class=\"creature-attack-dropdown\"> </span>  <br />The result appears in the chat window as a \"Public\" message If you want the outcome to be private select the appropriate setting from the chat drop down. <br /><br />As with all chat messages, the detailed dice break down of any damage rolls can be seen by clicking on the dice icon in the chat window. <br /> <span class=\"chat-roll\"> </span>  <br /><br />The Special Abilities section allows quick notes to be added with respect to the Creature or situation. More detailed notes can be added on the Notes tab in the rich text editor. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Creature Critical Injuries (3)</h2>\n<p>The GM can select a Critial Injuries table using the dropdown (by defailt it's set to \"None\") and the roll for Critial hits on the creature. The filter looks in the \"Alien Mother Tables\" folder for any table starting with \"Critical Injuries\" and lists them in the dropdown. If the table does not exist an error message is displayed. <br /><br />Right Clicking on the edit icon to the right will display a context menu allowing injury to be edited or deleted. <br /><br />You will have to manually add any modifiers the injury has on the character to the tab modifiers tab on the injury item. <br /><br />Right clicking on the \"Roll Crit\" button will display a dialogue box allowing the GM to enter a specific critical injury number. This must be in D6 format (number 1-6). This then rolls against the relevent table, writes to chat and creates the item on the sheet as per normal. <br /><br /><br />Using the Item type \"critical-injury\" a GM can create their own Critical Injury items which can then be dragged on to the sheet and will be displayed in this section and have the same controls for viewing, editing and deleting as a normal item. <br /><br /></p>\n<h5>Creating your own Creature Critical Injuries Tables</h5>\n<p>If you want to create your own tables for creatures, add a table to \"Alien Mother Tables\" as normal ensuring it starts with \"Critical Injuries \". <br />Make the Roll Table Formula 1d6. Add each of the rows as normal with the data in the following format: <br /><br /></p>\n<pre>&lt;b&gt;<em>Injury Name</em>&lt;/b&gt;<em>Injury Description</em></pre>\n<p><br /><strong>It is important to use this format as the code looks for the Injury Name within the bold html tags to create the item and message. </strong></p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Territories</h2>\nThe territories sheet allows you to create details about each of the sectors in space which you can share with the players. <br /> <span class=\"territories-general\"> </span>  <br />On the Systems tab you can drag systems (created as Items), clicking on the system name will open the associated sheet. <br />A right click on the Edit icon brings up the context menu to edit and delete the system attached to that sector. <br /> <span class=\"territories-systems\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Vehicles</h2>\nThough not used very much within the game the Vehicles template allows you to create vehicles within the system. <br />The Armor Rating is rollable and a right click will pop up the standard Armor Roll modification dialogue box. <br /><br /><strong>The GM should make all the players \"Owners\" of the vehicle in order for them to interact with it.</strong> <br /> <span class=\"vehicle-general\"> </span>  <br /><br />The Inventory tab allows the PCs to roll for the weapons on that vehicle and manage the weapons and other Items. <br />\"FootLocker\" has been added to stow the crews other gear. <br /> <span class=\"vehicle-inv\"> </span>  <br /><br />Right clicking on a weapon will show the weapon dialogue box. The drop down will show a list of the crew members that have been assigned either the \"PILOT\" or \"GUNNER\" roles (see below). <br />The player selects their character and applies and modifiers as instructed by the GM. <br />The selected PCs stats and stress dice will then be used to fire the weapon. <br />Rolls can be PUSHED and the additional stress dice will be added to the PCs sheet as normal. <br /> <span class=\"vehicle-fire-weapon\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />The Crew tab allows the GM drag PCs onto the sheet. <br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> ONLY THE GM CAN DRAG ACTORS ONTO THE VEHICLE. <br /><br />By default the crew member is assigned the position of \"PASSENGER\". <br /><br />Clicking on the dropdown allows the GM or Player to select one of the four roles:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COMMANDER:</strong> Has no function on a vehicle other than shouting at the crew!</li>\n<li><strong>PILOT:</strong> Allows the player to fire weapons and make Piloting rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>GUNNER:</strong> Allows the player to fire weapons.</li>\n<li><strong>PASSENGER:</strong> Along for the ride.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> The crew members are sorted in this order when their roles are assigned. <br /> <span class=\"vehicle-crew-selector\"> </span>  <br /><br />When \"PILOT\" is selected \"PILOTING\" will appear under the \"ROLL\" section of the Crew tab. <br />In order to make a Piloting check the player right clicks on this to make the roll (left click to see the modifier box). <br />The selected PCs stats and stress dice will then be used to make the piloting roll. <br />Rolls can be PUSHED and the additional stress dice will be added to the PCs sheet as normal. <br /> <span class=\"vehicle-crew\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Items/Item Types</h1>\nThere are a number of Item types that can be created for use within the system:\n<ul>\n<li>Item - General equipment</li>\n<li>Weapon - Personal and Vehicle weapons</li>\n<li>Armor - Personal armor</li>\n<li>Talent - Talents for use within the system</li>\n<li>Planet-System - Details of planetary systems</li>\n<li>Skill-Stunt - Place holders that drive the Skill-Stunts pop up on character sheets</li>\n<li>Agenda - PC Agenda and Story cards</li>\n<li>Specialty - Allows the GM to create new sub-careers, career specialities or your House Rule Careers and drop them on the character sheet.</li>\n<li>Critical Injury - Create Critical injuries with modifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Item</h2>\nThe item sheet is for generic items for use within the game. When a new item is created, choose the relevant item sub category from the dropdown. This will dynamically change the sheet to include any relevant stats for that item type on its Attributes tab. <br /> <span class=\"item-dropdown\"> </span>  <br />Any stats entered for the item will have an in-system effect once the item is \"Active\". <br />Item types: Data Storage,Diagnostics Display,Pharmaceuticals and Clothing have a Quantity field to record the number owned. <br />The Consumables type is a general item that includes stats for Power, Food, Water and Air Supply for any homebrew items. <br /><br />The modifiers tab allows you to add any +/- effects using the item may have on the PCs attributes or skills. <br /> <span class=\"modifiers-img\"> </span>  <br />Modifiers also have an in-system effect once the item is \"Active\". <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Weapon</h2>\nSelect the type on the sheet (Ranged or Melee) and the sheet will dynamically change to the relevant stats for that weapon type. The Class field is a text field which allow you to classify the weapon. This is not a required field and can be left blank. <br /> <span class=\"melee-img\"> </span>  <br /> <span class=\"ranged-img\"> </span>  <br />For a Melee weapon the range will be set to Engaged, for Ranged weapons select the appropriate range from the dropdown list. The Cost field will convert the input to a currency so all you need to enter is the number e.g., 15000 and it will reformat as US$15,000.00. <br /><br />The stats on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is \"Active\". <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Armor</h2>\nSetting up different armor types is simple as there are only two main stats to be considered, Armor Rating and Air Supply. <br /> <span class=\"armor-img\"> </span>  <br />The additional modifiers some armor can have on attributes and abilities can be found on the Modifiers tab. <br />The stats and modifiers on the sheet will be used in rolls when the weapon is \"Active\". <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Planet-System</h2>\nThe Planet-System sheet provides a method of documenting any planets the party might encounter during their missions. The fields are basic text and are intended to contain summaries. Where more detail is required, use the Rich Text editor in the Description tab. Once created these can be dragged onto the Territories sheet as previously mentioned. <br /> <span class=\"planet-system-img\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Agenda</h2>\nThe Agenda item provides a rich text field which can be used to provide additional scenario-based narrative/motivations for the players. These can be used as Agenda or Story cards. Once created, they can be dragged onto the PCs sheet where they appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Talent</h2>\nThis item type enables you to create talents for your game either homebrew or from the rulebook by adding descriptions to the rich test field. When dragged on to a PCs sheet, these will appear on the Skills tab and can be viewed by the player by clicking on the name. <br /><br /><strong> NOTE:</strong><br />With the exception of the \"Nerves of Steel\" talent, which will automatically add -2 to Stress rolls and the \"Pack Mule\" talent which increases total Encumbrance, Talents do not currently have an effect in the system so any impact deriving from a Talent needs to be applied manually during the game. <br /><br />For instance, the Compassion (Medic Talent) allows the PC to push their roll multiple times but the system will by default only allow a roll to be pushed once. In this situation the player should use the check box in the chat window \"Allow multi-push\". <br />When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <strong>before pushing the roll</strong>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress point is added to their sheet. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Critical Injury</h2>\nCritical Injury items can be dragged on to Character and Synthetic sheets to record permanent injuries as well as apply the appropriate roll modifiers as defined on the Modifiers tab. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng\">Skill-Stunt</h2>\nSkill-Stunt items contain a rich text field that can be populated with the Stunt data from the rulebook for each of the skills. <br /><br />If any of the official modules (Starter Set or Core Rules) are installed, the text in these items will be ignored but the items should not be deleted or the system will malfunction. <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Tokens</h1>\nWhen a Character actor is dragged onto a Scene the token will show resource bars for Stress and Health when the cursor is hovered over the token: <br /> <span class=\"character-token\"> </span>  <br /><br />For Creatures, the Health resource bar is shown: <br /> <span class=\"creature-token\"> </span>  <br /><br />By default, NPCs and Creature tokens are set as Hostile and Unlinked. <br /><br /><br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Rolling Dice</h1>\n<strong> NOTE:</strong> <em> The PC/Creature token needs to be selected for all rolls.</em> <br /><br /><em><strong> All GM Rolls are public by default but can be made private by using the Chat dropdown and selecting \"Private GM Roll\".</strong></em>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">Characters and NPCs</h2>\nFor Strength, Agility, Wits and Empathy rolls a Left mouse click will roll the value and Right mouse click will display a modifier box allowing additional dice to be added or subtracted as indicated by the GM. <br /> <span class=\"agil-mod\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />Stress is automatically added on a Push (see Rolls below) but any other adjustments to a characters Stress need to be made manually. The Stress value is taken into account on all dice rolls. <br /><br />For Panic rolls, the player Left clicks on \"Stress\" and the result is displayed in the chat window. Right Clicking on \"Stress\" will display a modifier box to add or remove stress to the roll. Chat message for stress rolls shows the net modifier. A tooltip shows the individual modifiers by hovering the mouse over \"Panic Condition\" in the chat window. <br /><br />This will add/subtract the entered value (+x or -x) to the roll and does not change the number of dice rolled. <br /> <span class=\"stress-mod\"> </span>    <br /><br />Supply rolls are made by clicking on the parachute icon. Any failures (1's) will automatically be deducted from the total and the items giving that value will be decremented. <br /><br />For Armor rolls the player just clicks on \"Armor\" and the appropriate number of dice are rolled with the result appearing in the character window. As before, the value depends on the equipped armor on the Inventory tab. Any reduction in armor value needs to be done in the detailed entry there. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">PUSHing Rolls</h2>\nRolls can be pushed for \"Human\" PCs by clicking on the Push icon in the chat window. If the initial roll includes a Facehugger (1), the \"Push\" button will not be displayed. When a roll is pushed, the PC's Stress level will automatically be increased by 1. <br /><br />On a Pushed roll the second chat message will show the total successes for both rolls. <br /><br />Some Talents enable PCs to push a roll twice. As these are situational (+2 Wits when doing X) they are very hard to code into the system. <br />To allow players to make multiple PUSHes there is a check box in the chat window \"Allow multi-push\". <br />When the situation complies with the Talent criteria the player checks the box, <strong>before pushing the roll</strong>, they then PUSH as normal and a Stress point is added to their sheet. <br /> <span class=\"mpush1\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />The results of the PUSH will display along with the total to that point and a second PUSH button will show (as long as there are no Facehuggers). <br /> <span class=\"mpush2\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />If the results of the second push are sufficient they just inform the GM of the result and continue playing using those results. <br /><br />If there are still not enough successes to complete the task the player can push the roll a second time and an additional Stress point is added to the sheet. <br /> <span class=\"mpush3\"> </span>    <br /><br /><br />Once again the total number of successes will be displayed for all three rolls. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">Creatures</h2>\nFor Mobility, Armor, Armor Vs Fire and Observation rolls, a Left mouse click will roll the value and Right mouse click will display a modifier box allowing additional dice to be added or subtracted as necessary. As some creatures have a different armor stat against fire damage this is shown as a separate field. <br /><br />Where creatures have the \"Acid Splash\" ability, a left click will display a dialogue box requesting the amount of damage the PC inflicted on the creature. <br /> <span class=\"acid-splash-popup\"> </span>  <br />This is added to the creatures “Acid Attack” value and the corresponding number of base dice are rolled with the result displayed in the chat window. For each success, the PC suffers the appropriate amount of damage as outlined in the core rules which should be manually applied by the player. <br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">Ad Hoc Rolls</h2>\nAlien RPG system uses custom dice notation for the Base and Stress dice. <br />If you want to roll ad-hoc dice and don't want to use the macros (See below). You can roll using: <br />/r xdb - for Base dice <br />/r xds - for Stress dice <br />where x is the number of dice. <br />For both just put /r 4db + 2ds <br /><br />If you need a D66 just use: <br />/r (1d6*10)+1d6 <br />(Note this will not rill Alien dice just normal D6 if using DsN) <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Combat Tracker</h1>\nWhen rolling for initiative in the combat tracker the combatants will now be sorted in ascending order. <br /> <span class=\"initiative-roll\"> </span>  <br /><br />When adding Creatures if their speed is greater than 1, clones will automatically be created equal to their speed. <br />If not required the GM can remove them by using the context menu. <br /><br />You can manually clone NPCs/Creatures by right clicking on an actor in the combat tracker you will see \"Clone Actor\" option appear. This will create a clone of the selected actor to allow the GM to give a Creature multiple initiative rolls. An actors initiative can be manually adjusted by selecting \"Update Actor\". <br /><br /> <span class=\"clone-actor\"> </span>   <span class=\"roll-clone\"> </span>  <br />Additionally, in the chat window an initiative card will be displayed. If you wish to modify these images you can by creating your own images (250x349px) png files and storing them in the \\images\\cards directory. Name the images in ascending order card-1.png to card-10.png. <br /> <span class=\"init-chat-norm\"> </span>  <br /><br />If you have purchased either the Starter Set or Core Rules these will automatically be replaced with the official Initiative cards. <br /> <span class=\"init-chat-cards\"> </span>  <br /><br />There are only 10 initiative cards, so if you have a combat with more than 10 actors and roll initiative the system will roll the first 10 then roll for any extras and add two decimal places to the rolls i.e. 3.42. <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Tables</h1>\nWhen the system is installed it will create the following folder structure:\n<table style=\"width:43%\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:30%\">Alien Tables -&gt;</td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Alien Creature Tables </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:30%\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width:50%\">Alien Mother Tables</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThis structure is used by the Creature sheet and the two \"roll on table\" macros (See Macros) which are set up to display only the rollable tables in those folders. <br />Free League have given me permission to include the Panic Table in the core system, which can be found in the Alien Mother Tables. <br /><br />If you want to create your own rollable tables, you should do so in the appropriate folder. <br /><br />When entering the tables from the rulebook for D66 tables use 10*1d6+1d6 as the roll table formula and you will be able to import the ranges as per the book. <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">System Configuration Options</h1>\nThere are a number of system configuration options available to GM and players under Configuration Settings&gt;System Settings: <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">GM Configuration Options</h3>\n <span class=\"gm-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br />Hopefully, most of the settings are self-explanatory. <br /><br />Enabling the \"Add Settings Button\" will place a quick access button on the Configure Settings sidebar to quickly allow the GM and Players to change fonts and text colours. <br /> <span class=\"style-button-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Player Configuration Options</h3>\n <span class=\"player-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\">Font and Colour Configuration Options</h3>\nWhen I first created the system, I wanted to give the feel of the old CRT monitors you see in the films. While this initially looks good after playing for a while the text style and colour can be a little intense. <br />Additionally, having the text colour green can cause issues for people with sight problems. <br /><br />There is also an option to change the Journal font color settings. <br />Please note that some of the font colors are baked into the modules journal settings so will not change. <br /><br />FranzWarm wrote a really great add-on module called CRT UI. Unfortunately he no longer supports the module so I have incorporated it into the core system.<br /><br />The UI components are now on by default and the sheets can be changed, by the players, selecting the CRT UI button on the \"Configure Alien RPG Settings\" menu. <br /><br />The can be reverted to the default sheet by selecting the \"Reset\" option. <br /><br />In order to make the system more accessible, there are configuration options available to change these settings for individual players.  <span class=\"style-settings\"> </span>  <br /><br /><br /> <span class=\"font-picker-img\"> </span>   <span class=\"colour-picker-img\"> </span>  <br /><br />Clicking the Reset button will return the system to the defaults. <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Macros</h1>\nThe Alien system comes with 4 macros that will help you run the game smoothly. <br /><br />These can be found in the Compendium under Macro&gt;Alien. I suggest you right click and do an \"Import All Content\" to get them into your library.\n<ol>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Alien - GM Dice Roller:</strong> Allows you to perform ad-hoc dice rolls.

The company orders the crew to investigate under penalty of total forfeiture of shares. Finding a derelict ship, they discover an alien lifeform that threatens to kill them—and a member of the crew itself has a corporate directed agenda to protect it. <br />The particulars of this crime, however, are quite different. <br /><em> Chariot of the Gods</em> is a complete Cinematic scenario for the ALIEN roleplaying game. It’s designed to introduce the game to the players while at the same time take them for a thrilling, terrifying ride into space where no one can hear them scream. The scenario is designed for 3–5 players plus GM, and takes at least 4-5 hours to complete.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">CHARACTERS</h2>\n<p>This scenario comes with five pre-generated player characters—the crew of the USCSS Montero starfreighter. Filled-in character sheets for these PCs can be found in the Actors PC's section of the module. Let the players choose who they want to play. <br />If you have fewer than five players, the leftover crew members are NPCs under your control. <br />When your players have chosen their starting PCs, read <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"at7Vs915ifD5qP43\">WHAT'S THE STORY MOTHER?</a> out loud to the players. <br />Then show the players the map of the Montero and hand each player their Personal Agenda (see below) for the first Act to kick off the action. <br /><br />If any of the PCs should die during the course of the scenario, you can use NPCs from the crew of the USCSS Cronus or the Sotillo as replacements. Let the player choose a Buddy and Rival for their new character if they wish. For replacement PCs, use character sheets downloaded from the Free League website. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">GEAR:</strong> The PCs start the scenario with no personal gear except their signature items. As the scenario kicks off, the PCs may distribute the gear available on the Montero (see  <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"KqOP7BkTmTewzHlQ\">04. USCSS MONTERO</a> ) as they — or rather, Captain Miller — sees fit.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">PERSONAL AGENDAS</h2>\n<p>Each character has a Personal Agenda for each of the three Acts of the scenario. These Agendas are printed on playing cards included in this boxed set. At the start of each Act, give each player their new Agenda for the Act about to start, and <strong>tell them not to reveal it to the other players.</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> SPECIAL ORDER 966: </strong>At the start of the scenario, give Wilson's player the card entitled “Special Order 966” in addition to their Agenda.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> EVALUATING AGENDAS: </strong>At the end of each Act, collect the Agendas from the players and evaluate them individually. If you feel a player has actively advanced their PC’s Agenda despite significant personal risk or sacrifice, announce this and award them one Story Point (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"Ur3VsDVpi1zCKyXG\">PERSONAL STUFF</a>). <br />Don’t reveal the actual Agendas to the entire group, they should remain hidden until the end of the scenario.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> REPLACEMENT PLAYER CHARACTERS: </strong>Only original PCs have pre-written Personal Agendas for the three Acts of the scenario. NPCs used as replacement PCs have only one Agenda that remains the same for the entire scenario.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">THE SECRET ANDROID</h2>\n<p>One of the crew members on the Montero is in fact a synthetic undercover agent codenamed Lucas, working for Bionational—a corporate rival to Weyland-Yutani. <br />After the players have chosen PCs, decide which one of them is Lucas. When you hand out Personal Agendas, replace the chosen PC’s Agendas with Lucas’s Agendas. At the start of the scenario, give Lucas's player the card entitled “Note to Lucas” in addition to their Act I Agenda. Lucas can be an NPC if you prefer. <br /><br />To avoid detection, Lucas mimics human behavior to perfection. <br />As long as Lucas is not exposed, use rules for humans for the android—pushing rolls, gaining Stress Level, making Panic Rolls, etc. Only if Lucas suffers a critical injury is the android automatically revealed—as it bleeds white, not red. <br /><br />From the moment Lucas is exposed, it follows the rules for androids (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"O77NXruJ0vG2brzk\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>). <br /><br />When exposed, Lucas also shows its true power—the android's Strength and Agility increase by +3 each, also affecting Health, including current Health. Lucas's behavioral inhibitors are removed, allowing it to hurt humans. <br /><br /><strong> CALLING PVP.</strong> Revealing Lucas as an android has a high risk of triggering direct confrontations with other PCs. <br />If this happens, play out the current scene and then turn Lucas into an NPC, letting the player choose another character (someone from the crew of the Cronus) to play.</p>\n</div>","folder":"RvXrz6xgpieLnxg1","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"YEoPmwinvi5w1FW6":3,"3SlHgCFcwdscgES2":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-cotg-scenario.DPwCTEi971M1bnZc"}}}

Only five small planetoids that orbit extremely close to their sun remain in a system that is estimated to once have hosted over thirty planets and moons.

The planetoid spins too slowly and is too small to capture its own atmosphere. The only thing of note in the system is the listening and monitoring post Znoy (Russian for “Heat”). Znoy is but one of many such posts across the UPP border, all connected by a grid of sensor satellites that record any incursions. Unfortunately, the sensors are rudimentary at best, so it is often difficult for the outpost staff to determine if an invasion fleet is on its way or if the grid has simply registered a rogue comet or stellar debris. While new arrivals here scramble to alert the UPP SOF Command of any contact, old timers know the drill. Znoy Outpost is mostly underground, having been driven into the rock like a giant stake. During the day, the outpost unfurls a solar shield to both protect it from the direct heat and to harness the star’s rays and recharge its power cells.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><br /><br /><br /><br />A “day” on 17 Phei Phei E lasts nearly two Earth months while a “night” lasts about 28 Earth days. Supply ships can only approach when the outpost is on the night side, as the planetoid itself shields the transports from the extreme heat of the sun. <br />Assignment to Znoy is considered a punishment. It is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area. While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations. To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley’s Hope. If such an attack did happen, the UAAC believes it would have originated from Znoy.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Veil, Bao Sau Sector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">UPP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">No atmosphere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">–173°C at night to 427°C during the day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Barren cratered rock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">None, military monitoring outpost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">115 soldiers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Heavy metals in asteroid belt</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"D2b6SfDieYag0asd","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"3IXw5YyvjaVDm2Io":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.HyDluFPSW4kJEkf9"}}}

Established in 2157, the colony is a terraforming, research, and mining facility, and a new home to its pioneers. <br /><br />By 2179 there are 158 colonists there, and the first natives of LV-426 had been born. The giant processors are changing the atmosphere: now breathable, but still choked by dense clouds and wracked by electrical storms. The sky is always gloomy, more like night than day. Even when the sun is above the horizon it’s often hidden behind the giant form of Calpamos, LV-426’s parent planet. <br /><br />Some said building the colony was unwise. The moon hadn’t even been mapped in 2157, the weather would make life a constant struggle, and the violent geology made it feel as if the world didn’t want anyone there at all. Yet someone at Weyland-Yutani allocated the budget and gave the green light, and so Hadley’s Hope was founded. <br /><br />Supervisor Al Simpson got stuck into the job and the colonists soon learned to live with LV-426’s quirks. It wasn’t long before they were making a success of this most unlikely of colonies.Hope's Last Day tells the story of the final hours of Hadley’s Hope, all through the eyes of five colonist workers. It offers a brief taste of Cinematic gameplay and drops the players straight into the action. <br /><br />The pre-generated characters all have their own Agendas, Buddies, and Rivals, but together they have one desperate collective mission: to escape LV-426 alive. This short scenario encompasses what would normally be the third and final Act of a three-Act Cinematic scenario, and can be played in less than two hours. It is designed to give you a brief taste of Cinematic gameplay—for the full Cinematic experience, see the full-length Chariot of the Gods scenario by Andrew E.C. Gaska, published separately. <br /><br />More Cinematic scenarios will be published soon. <br /><br />Begin play by having your players choose their characters (or select them randomly) and read the intro text “<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-hopes-last-day-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"blDrDrH1vkEKVjlf\">What's the Story Mother?</a>” to them.</p>\n<br /><br /></div>","folder":"N3DPtoTJhjf91Wh9","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CnrW4G4ZnTHuAkok":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-hopes-last-day-scenario.QeYBp9wHCS3RJN1U"}}}

It’s obscured by static but they can make out the following: <br /><br /><em> “This is an emergency message. <br />All colonists must immediately assemble at the main storeroom on the sub-level for safety.” </em><br /><br />After several repeats, the message cuts off with an electronic screech, and the PCs get no response if they try the intercom. <br /><br />In that deadened silence they hear a gunshot and a lonesome scream that echoes through the ventilation ducts: it could have come from anywhere (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>). Anyone who could really help—the colony’ research team, security detail, Supervisor Simpson and the rest of the administration—are nowhere to be found. <br /><br />Something is seriously wrong, and it’s time to start planning how to get the hell out of Dodge. <br /><br />The players should be thinking about finding Company Agent Reynolds or Dr. Komiskey and their keycards, and they know where they are likely to be found: the offices on blocks C2 and E2. <br /><br />Let the players explore the base freely, but feel free to nudge them toward Reynolds and Komiskey if they seem lost. <br /><br />The game starts out in stealth mode.

Here, you'll get a sample of two varieties. In combat, Xenomorphs follow special rules—primarily, they have a Speed rating and they have signature attacks. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SKILLS:</strong> Xenomorphs don’t have attributes like humans. They can use specific skills, and then roll a number of Base Dice equal to their skill level only. Xenomorphs can have skill levels much higher than humans. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ARMOR RATING:</strong> Most Xenomorphs also have a thick hide, resistant to attacks, giving them a natural Armor Rating (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"EX2v5xgvfJJeySIC\">DAMAGE</a>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HEALTH:</strong> When a Xenomorph is reduced to zero Health, it isn’t Broken in the way a human is. Instead, roll a D6 on the critical injury table to the right. If a Xenomorph with zero Health is injured again, roll again on the critical injury table. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPECIAL ABILITIES:</strong> Some Xenomorphs have special actions beyond the signature attacks.

Humans can only move two zones, i.e. they have a Speed of 1.</li>\n<li>In combat, a Xenomorph gets to act one time for each point of Speed in each Round. Draw one initiative card for each point of Speed. At each point of action, the xenomorph gets to perform one fast and one slow action.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Most Xenomorphs attack only in close combat, at <strong>Engaged</strong> range. However, they don’t make ordinary close combat attacks. Instead, each time a Xenomorph attacks, roll a D6 or choose an attack on the table for the creature’s signature attacks, and resolve the effects. Some signature attacks are extremely deadly.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong> CRITICAL INJURIES ON XENOMORPHS </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">CRIT</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">EFFECT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Rise Again</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">The Xeno­morph falls to the ground, seemingly dead, but it’s a ruse.

It is believed that an ecological disaster there brought on by the release of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 in the atmosphere led to the accelerant settling on and mutating native fungal and insect life to produce a living nightmare. Similar to a Xeno­morph XX121, the Neomorph parasite (P. <em>celerius</em>) is delivered to a host via a carrier organism (<em>Tachinidae tabellarium</em>). Once implanted, the parasite gestates within a living host who is killed by the creature’s violent birth. There are a number of differences, however, causing the creature to be classified separately.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:</strong> Appearance - wise, Neomorphs are eyeless and have gray-white translucent skin, a fleshy spiked tail, an elongated bulbous head, and a sphincter-like facial orifice that distends to reveal a mouth full of cruel teeth. While their blood is translucent yellow like that of a Xeno­morph, it is not acidic. They make subtle clicking sounds and exhibit animal snarls and screeches, as well as making a distinct hooting sound as adults. Neomorphs are more animalistic than their Xeno­morph brethren and are clearly not as intelligent. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STAGES:</strong> A Neomorph’s life cycle is broken down into five known stages that are covered below, as well as various termination protocols associated with each stage. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STERILIZATION:</strong> Neomorphs are genetically programmed to kill all life. Believed by some to be a derivative of the black liquid, P. <em>celerius</em> was likely designed by the Engineers to clear a planet of any indigenous species still living after Agent A0-3959X.91-15 had wiped out the majority of a planet’s population.</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Small, bulbous pods that grow like fungus, the egg sacs are the result of the mutagenic Agent A0-3959X.91-15 interacting with pollen and microbial elements on a planet or in a spacecraft. Once formed, these bird’s egg-sized pods tend to grow in clutches of 2D6 — and there are often several clutches in any infected area. The egg sacs are the delivery system for the Neomorphic Motes (see Stage II). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best way to be rid of the Egg Sacs is to expose them to severe temperature changes — they can be destroyed with fire or made inert with liquid nitrogen (at least until they thaw). <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE II: NEOMORPHIC MOTES</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>When the egg sacs are disturbed, they release what appears to be a puff of pollen. In reality, it is a synchronized swarm of highly infectious <em>Tachinidae tabellarium</em> motes, smaller than grains of sand. Possessing a primal hive intelligence, the motes target the nearest potential host and zero-in on an unprotected orifice such as the eyes, ears, nose, throat, or an open wound. From there they enter the bloodstream and inject microscopic amounts of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 into the victim’s white blood cells. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">INFECTION:</strong> Exposure to Neomorphic Motes is normally handled as a disease with Virulence 9. If the Sickness Roll fails, the patient enters Stage III within one Shift. No more Sickness Rolls are made.For the purposes of this Cinematic scenario, you are well within your rights to skip the roll and simply decide which PC or NPC is infected and enters Stage III and when, for maximum dramatic effect. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Neomorphic Mote tend to avoid smoke and are killed by fire.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE III: NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE IV: Neophyte (Juvenile neomorph)</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<p>Once the Motes enter a host’s bloodstream, they deliver their microscopic payload and die. The injected Agent A0-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall. This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass—such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster. <br /><br />If lodged in a region of the body with dense muscle or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host—using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew. The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster. <br /><br />Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours. These rabid quadrupedal creatures rely on their speed and agility to avoid damage. Emerging about 0.3 meters in length, Bloodbursters continue to grow exponentially, visibly getting larger as they move about. Highly aggressive, they lash out at anything and everything around them. They use their claws, tail, and teeth to savagely maul their victims. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> A patient entering Stage III is immediately killed outright by the birth of the Bloodburster. The newly born Bloodburster takes one Round to sluggishly free itself from its amniotic sack. As soon as it is free, it flies into a savage rage and attacks any living creature it encounters. See the table of signature attacks below. After just a few Turns, the Bloodburster enters Stage IV (juvenile Neomorph). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> As a slow action, the Bloodburster can sprint as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range from a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best bet is to attack a Bloodburster right after birth—before it has sluggishly freed itself from its amniotic sack (above). Fire or any serious damage done to the creature at this time causes it to run off and hide while it rapidly grows to its juvenile form.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>TYPICAL STATS <br />NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">SPEED:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">HEALTH:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Mobility 9, Observation 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3 (zero against fire damage)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<p>Growing from 1.2 to 1.8 meters in length, a juvenile Neomorph continues to maneuver on all fours. While their heads are still bulbous, they have begun to elongate and taper to a point. They are aggressive hunters who are hard to frighten away.

The remains of a partly dissected Facehugger lie pinned to a board. <br />A half-eaten doughnut sits on a desk. <br />In one sealed cabinet there are three alien eggs. <br />They look, and are, alive (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"oCw6dQGMiiemNmlm\">THE XENO­MORPHS</a>). There are various medical containers and equipment bags lying about that could be used to carry an egg. The cabinet can easily be broken open (only two points of damage needed). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">E2 – COMMAND, MEDICAL, MORGUE: </strong><br />The Command Center takes up the upper floor of E Block. <br /><br />It consists of the Command Room (known as Ops), Assistant Operations Manager Lydecker’s office, the medlab and the morgue. <br /><br /><strong>The Medlab</strong> consists of an examination room and the quarantine booth (that is locked from the outside but has a viewing window and intercom). The place is in shambles, empty cabinets flung open and over-turned in the mad scramble for medical supplies.<br /><br />Dr. Komiskey (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@Actor[Theodora Komiskey]</span> ) is trapped in the quarantine room, automatically sealed when the base went into lockdown. Along with Komiskey in the quarantine room the PCs can see the dead body of a man on an examination table, a specimen tube with a live Facehugger (counts as one inventory item), and a dead Facehugger on the floor.<br /><br />Dr. Komiskey is leaning against the viewing window, old tear tracks on her cheeks.<br />She has woken up after having been facehugged and knows she is doomed.<br />She has just given the man on the table a massive overdose to kill him, as he’s been facehugged as well, but can’t summon the courage to kill herself.<br />She is in shock, and pleads with the PCs to release her.<br />After much sobbing, she will agree to help them escape in the shuttle. She has the keycard on a lanyard around her neck.<br /><br />Calming down, Komiskey rambles on about how Reynolds intercepted a transmission from some corporate exec on Earth and decided to elbow in on the potential find. <br />She assembled her inspection team off the books and came here. If the PCs ask about the man on the table, she will tell them that he (Michael Drapers) is dead. She killed him to spare him a terrible fate. <br /><br />She won’t volunteer the fact that she has been facehugged, but if they make a successful <strong>MANIPULATION</strong> roll against her, she will admit it (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong> to all who hear that).<br /><br />The door to the quarantine room cannot be opened from the inside. <br />The PCs can open it with a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll. <br />If they fail, they can break it down, but it has Armor Rating 6 and requires twelve points of damage to be breached—a sure way to alert the Drone one floor down. <br /><br />If the PCs release Dr. Komiskey, the Chestburster in her can be birthed later (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[05. EVENTS]</span>). <br />She will also show the PCs the hyper-coolant spray canisters her team has been using to keep eggs in a dormant state for transport (keeps an egg dormant for D6 Turns).<br /><br />Ops is the nerve center of the colony, monitoring vital functions and security. <br />It’s usually busy but right now it’s unmanned. <br />The intercom hisses static, a screen flickers. <br />The CCTV system is damaged, but a successful <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll gives access to a few cameras. Flicking through, the PCs see scenes of carnage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A view of the carnage in the Sublevel Areas—see the text to the right (+1 <strong>Stress Level</strong>).</li>\n<li>A deserted corridor. In the distance, there’s movement. Zooming in, you catch sight of the bloodied remains of a person being dragged slowly out of view (Block A1, Offices).</li>\n<li>Movement on another camera, one showing Block E1, South Lock.

Covered in scuff and scratch marks on the inside, the door does not close again once opened. After breaching the buckled door, the PCs must connect the <em>Montero’s</em> passageway umbilical to the <em>Cronus</em> and pressurize it before opening the inner airlock door.

When operational, massive carbon filters clean the air of pollutants while churning machines electrolyze the water and generate oxygen. Powered by a direct feed from the reactors, the shaft terminates in a water-filled chamber on Deck C. <br />Condensation accumulates at the top of the shaft and rains down here. <br /><br />When the PCs arrive, the oxygen generation is offline. <br />The shaft is dark and the water at the bottom of the shaft is frozen. Once MU/TH/UR 2000 goes online and power is restored, the air scrubbers are activated and the ice melts. This chamber then becomes very noisy and it is difficult to hear anything — all <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> rolls get a –2 modification in here. <br />The air scrubbers work via electrolysis—electrical current is channeled through submerged rods and applied to the water, causing the separation of hydrogen and oxygen. That means that there is a real risk of electrocution in here once the power is back on. Any failed skill roll in here results in an immediate attack rolled with six Base Dice and Damage 1. The carbon filters on the air scrubbers are caked with decades of grime and mold, and just restoring power won’t be enough to return them to working order. The carbon filters need to either be replaced or cleaned in order for the air circulating on the ship to return to proper oxygen levels. This requires a Shift of work and a successful <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll. <br />Only one PC can roll, but others can help. <br /><br />If the PCs actively examine the carbon filters before they get to work, they spot Neomorphic Egg Sacs growing on them (see  <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JA6vun1j3OwHEqSv\">09.

Instead, it turned out to be a large terrestrial world with heavy metal deposits. The planet is rich in natural ores, a fact that Weyland-Yutani has taken advantage of for more than a century via extensive mining operations. Vast sections of the planet’s surface have been strip-mined, leaving behind huge gouges and deep canyon trenches. Much of the material exported from the far Frontier is routed through either Thedus or Anchorpoint Station before heading to the Outer Veil and Core Systems. Due to a severe environmental accident in 2109, parts of the planet were rendered uninhabitable for many decades. A miners’ revolt over poor living conditions led to the troop carrier UAS Archangel being deployed to the planet in order to keep the peace. Through a series of classified events, the Archangel crashed, destroying one of the planet’s atmospheric processors and causing the deaths of over 15,000 civilians and marines. As of the 2180s, renewed terraforming has repaired much of the planetary damage, but Thedus’ atmosphere is still cold.

{"_id":"Xl2nurPibjqvNxHk","name":"04. USCSS MONTERO","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">LOCKMART CM-88G BISON-CLASS FREIGHTER</h2>\n<p>The Montero is of the same series of starfreighter as the Nostromo, save that it is a newer model with some minor upgrades. The most important distinction is that the Montero has standard Saturn J 3000 engines, instead of the Rolls-Royce N66 Cyclone upgrades that the Nostromo had. As such, she is not rated as a commercial tug. She is fitted to haul cargo internally like a standard freighter, and has a cavernous bay with ventral access. <br /><br />This scenario starts off on the Montero, and an overview of the main personnel deck can be seen to the right. The rest of the ship is not mapped out in detail, as it is unlikely that the PCs will spend much time here—see Events. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CARGO:</strong> The Montero’s bay is currently full of 72 high-pressure tanks carrying 200,000 tons of aging yet still highly flammable Tritium.

As the prison allows visitors, processing centers had to be built to accommodate them. Eventually, several visiting families decided to settle there, transforming the processing center into its own corporate run colony. Settlements developed in radiating lines from the massive prison facility and collectively became known as “the Sprawl.” <br />Taking advantage of its natural resources, the Seegson Corporation built several factories in the Sprawl to mass-produce gyrocars. As Weyland Corp developed better technologies, the Seegson models became less popular. The factories closed, the colony became destitute and the future prospects for those living there grew increasingly bleak. Taking advantage of the situation, the Colonial Marine Corps opened their largest recruitment center in the Outer Rim on DP-27.

THE SITUATION","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">SCENARIO OVERVIEW</h2>\n<p>The starfreighter USCSS <em>Montero</em> is diverted to check out a distress signal sent by the USCSS <em>Cronus</em>, a science exploration ship that has been missing for three quarters of a century. The crew of the <em>Montero</em> investigate and find the few remaining <em>Cronus</em> crew in stasis and the ship overrun by alien creatures. As they attempt to transfer the survivors to the Montero, the starfreighter’s reactor is set to overload by one of the crew, who has orders to bring back the xeno­morphic materials the <em>Cronus</em> is carrying. With their ship destroyed, the <em>Montero</em> crew is forced to repair the <em>Cronus</em> instead. <br /><br />The crew soon finds themselves caught between corporate agents who put their mission and a paycheck ahead of human lives, the crew of the <em>Cronus</em> who are suffering from an infection that is slowly turning them into monsters, feral alien creatures that are out for blood, and a murderous android who wants to stop Weyland-Yutani from getting their hands on anything alien. Just when the <em>Montero</em> crew discover that they too might be infected, pirates attempt to seize the ship. It all comes down to one question — <em> does the crew want to stop a dangerous biological weapon from getting into the wrong hands, or do they want to become very, very rich? </em></p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE CRONUS?</h2>\n<p>Acting on classified data from an encrypted transmission, the Cronus was launched in 2110 to attempt to locate samples of Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91–15. <br />Deciphering part of the data transmission led them to the 26 Draconis system and a small planetoid dubbed LV-1113 tucked away in the planetary debris belt shared by the suns of this trinary star system. <br /><br />The chemical was discovered there, but some of it had been previously deployed, causing mutations in the planet’s lifeforms. <br />While the science team modified and experimented with what they called the 26 Draconis strain of the black liquid, members of the crew became infected with Mote pathogen spores, causing them to give birth to Bloodbursters which quickly matured into Neomorphs. <br /><br />Chaos soon broke out. <br /><br />There was a mutiny, the science module on the Cronus was ejected and left behind, and the surviving crew escaped the planetoid.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE 26 DRACONIS STRAIN: </strong> <br />Discovering that some among them had been infected by the spores before departing, the remaining scientists used a derivative of the 26 Draconis strain to inoculate the crew against the Neomorph spores. <br />The doctors administering it were unaware that their cure was not completely safe, however — nor that it could cause those inoculated to mutate into Abominations. <br />As some of the inoculated began to transform and others didn’t, the crew of the Cronus failed to make the correlation. Nonetheless, as the ship was overrun with Neomorphs and Abominations, they realized they were in over their heads. <br /><br />Barricading themselves on cryodeck and leaving the ship’s synthetic — Ava — to maintain the infested ship, they put themselves in stasis and hoped for a miracle. After being caught in a micro-meteorite storm, navigation control failed on the Cronus and her comms array was damaged. <br /><br />Ava was attacked by the Abominations while attempting to repair the engines. <br /><br />Life support failed, plunging the ship into a deep cold. <br /><br />The crew remained safe in their hypersleep chambers, and the creatures aboard went into a state of suspended animation. <br /><br />This all happened within two days of leaving LV-1113. Since then, the Cronus has been adrift, barreling along at sublight speeds for decades.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">MOTHER’S NOTE: </strong> <br />The 26 Draconis Strain inoculation works — 95% of the time it does indeed arrest the development of any Neomorph spores deposited by the Motes. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there is also a significant risk of the black liquid derivative going too far and recoding the DNA of the inoculated, slowly transforming them into zombie-like Abominations (see  <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JA6vun1j3OwHEqSv\">09.

The blast shutters are still lowered, shut tight around the viewports. There is soot on the ceiling and several of the stations are burned out. <br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Command Station:</strong> Once power is up, the command station works like a charm. Located under a flip-up access panel on one of the treadmill arms of the captain’s station is a small compartment that houses MU/TH/UR 2000’s emergency access key. <br />The glass panel that it typically lies behind is shattered, the key missing. The captain’s station monitors all relevant “at a glance” information from other consoles. <br />If the PCs access the command station and make a <strong>COMTECH roll</strong>, they can find information on where the <em>Cronus</em> has been: <strong> on a distant, uncharted planet in the 26 Draconis system</strong>. </li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Sensor Station:</strong> This station was also damaged by the fire but can be repaired to working order with a Shift of work and a <strong>COMTECH roll</strong> roll. The damaged sensors sporadically pick up a sensor ghost (see the Sensor Ghost Redux <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"pQqVx7dIpbtm0DNa\">07.

The carbon dioxide content in the ship’s recycled air is high — maintenance must be performed on the air scrubbers. <br />The carbon filters in the Oxygen Generation System must be replaced (see Bad Air <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JBcvxlIinoMKSDMB\">07.

While it looks untouched, Station 2 is also dead—something that is not evident until power is restored. It’s possible to open up some of the deck plating and try to reconnect power (requires one Shift of work and a successful <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll), but an easier solution would be to cannibalize Station 2’s parts to reactivate Station 1 (also one Shift of work, but a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll at +2). Only one pilot station is needed to fly the ship.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MED LAB</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Within this room are two older-generation Pauling Medpods (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"OKl6O6GULd7wEfUd\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>). <br />One has its plexiglass tube splintered and shattered as if something broke out of it. <br />The other is sealed and lit from within, but the entire inner surface of the plexiglass is covered in thick dried blood. There is a row of large specimen jars. <br />Floating within two of them are two small alien creatures <br />(Bloodbursters, see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JA6vun1j3OwHEqSv\">09. THE XENOMORPHS</a>). <br />On a far shelf is a smaller specimen jar without liquid, containing the same fungal nodes (Neomorphic Egg Sacs) that can be found in various areas of the ship. On the desk next to that is an open metallic urn. <br />Four organic-looking glass vials are inside the urn — three of those are intact with some kind of black liquid within them, while the fourth is cracked open and empty.\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Vials:</strong> If a PC decides to take a vial with them, they had best keep it in cold storage. <br />If it starts to sweat, it releases its contents and begins to affect the PCs (see next page).</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">The Cure:</strong> Under the desk is a medkit case that contains six syringes full of the 26 Draconis Strain derivative, a “cure” for those infected by Neomorphic Motes <br />(see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JA6vun1j3OwHEqSv\">09.

Both those infected and the embryonic Neomorphs were killed in the process. The medpods were included on this mission specifically for operating on and removing parasitic organisms.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Motes:</strong> If anyone disturbs the egg sac nodes within the sealed jars, motes eject from them and attempt to find a way out, eventually settling down and dying from lack of a host. <br />However, if the container is broken or opened in some way, the motes spread throughout the ship.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Medpod:</strong> The broken medpod works ( <strong> MEDICAL AID</strong> +3), but any PC who uses it risks sepsis because of the unsanitary environment <br />(roll for a disease with Virulence 6, see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"O77NXruJ0vG2brzk\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>). If a PC is morbidly curious and opens the bloody medpod, they find the remains of a Stage IV Abomination within. Locked in the device to be vivisected, the former crew member’s lower torso has been dissected, and his soft elongated skull has been opened and picked at. Data gathered from the exploratory surgery can be accessed using the medical computer at the desk. <br />While he appears dead, the decades-old Abomination has one last gasp in him, which he uses to savagely attack the closest PC. <br />With its brain exposed, however, the dreadful thing is easy enough to kill (only 3 Health left and no Armor Rating).</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Meds and Drugs: </strong> Four personal medkits, surgical instruments, and D6 doses each of Neversleep Pills, Hydr8tion, and Naproleve can all be found in the cabinets here.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SCIENCE LAB 2</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>This is a charred shell of a room — whatever happened here, the crew ended it real quick with the liberal use of an incinerator or two. <br />There’s the burnt-out, partial remains of a drum of some kind in the room, and a body buried in the debris, its arms shriveled up and clutching at its chest. <br />The stale air is thick with the smell of burnt rubber, plastic, and flesh. <br />There is nothing worthwhile in here — save for the discovery that the body is not quite human. <br />It is the remains of a Stage IV Abomination, its gelatinous cowl boiled away and its features obscured by charring. <br />The one giveaway that it is something inhuman is the length of its forearms, something any Scientist can confirm using the <strong>ANALYSE</strong> talent.

Without the code, the safe needs to be cracked (requires a Shift of work and a –3 <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll), or the door needs to be blown, requiring an explosion with Blast Power of 12 or more—which damages the cube and destroys most of the cash.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:5%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Wetbar:</strong> The bar here was practically cleaved in two.

The United States Oil Wars have taken their toll on North America. The recent Australian Rebellion against the 3WE was ended swiftly with the nuclear strike on the Outback’s capital, Canberra. The cost of living on Earth is extravagant, and those who aren't rich are confined to metropolitan ghettoes.

Never one to miss a beat, Weyland-Yutani converted the worksite to a Class C Work Correctional Unit and lead works for radioactive and toxic waste disposal, leasing it to the Three World Empire. While at its height the facility housed thousands of prisoners, it was closed in the 2170s—leaving only a custodial staff and less than two dozen inmates to keep the facility running.In 2179, an EEV pod from the errant starship Sulaco crash-landed on the planet, bringing some kind of contagion. Rumors suggest it was a rare strain of Cholera.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><span class=\"Fori16\"> </span>  Whatever it was, the convicts stationed there made unauthorized use of the facility's stores of quinitricetyline in an attempt to burn away the infectious agent, accidentally killing several of their own in the process. Weyland-Yutani dispatched the Medical frigate Patna to Fury 161 but were too late to save all but one inmate—Robert Morse. <br />The story has been sensationalized by Morse’s banned book Space Beast, in which he claims that it wasn’t a contagion but a hostile organism that was on board the EEV, and that it slew nearly everyone before it was finally put down. Morse also claims the company was at fault for the massacre. Weyland-Yutani has recently put the facility on the market to be sold as scrap, but so far there has been no takers.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Veil, Neroid Sector, Anglo-Japanese Arm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Weyland-Yutani, Three World Empire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, constantly swept with howling winds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">–20°C to a balmy 40°C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Flat deserts and dark acidic oceans</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Former industrial colony turned prison, now closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Formerly labor force and heavy metals, now industrial scrap and quinitricetyline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"D2b6SfDieYag0asd","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"3IXw5YyvjaVDm2Io":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ghIki0QsI0Ot4mdh"}}}

The colonist Wes Osterman is trapped in Billy’s Bar. He keeps buzzing until they answer and then he will beg for help. If they don’t answer, the noise will make any Xenos in their area <strong>ACTIVE</strong>. <br />Osterman has locked the door, but something is trying to get in. In the background they can hear the dull thump, thump, thump of something heavy battering the door to the bar. If they decide to help Wes, there is a Xeno Drone breaking in through the ground floor doors. It’s happy to find other, easier prey. <br />If the PCs wait too long to decide, they hear the door to the bar finally give way, along with the squeals of the Xeno and the screams of Osterman as he is taken away to the hive (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE BIRTH:</strong> If the PCs have rescued Dr. Komiskey from the Medlab or Maria Hemming from Tannen's Casino, the Chestbursters inside them will be born sooner or later (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"oCw6dQGMiiemNmlm\">THE XENO­MORPHS</a>).

Using these images, you can create tiles for use in your games.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Recommended Add-on Modules</h1>\n<p>While not necessary to use the Alien system of this module I would recommend installing the following Add-on modules as they make the GM's job a lot easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Dice So Nice:</strong> <br />Alien RPG supports 2 dice face types. <br />There is an issue with DsN where the dice do not pick of the correct colour when first used.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">The Furnace:</strong> <br />Provides enhanced macro functions required for multiple initiative rolls if you don't use Reverse Initiative Order.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Cursor Hider:</strong> <br />Stops GM and players seeing cursors moving around the screen.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PnP - Pointer and Pings:</strong> <br />Useful for pointing things out to the players and pulling their map focus to where you want it.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Reverse Initiative Order:</strong> <br />Reverses the Initiative order in the combat tracker and allow you to add the same Actor multiple times which is useful for Xenos.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:2%\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Quick Insert - Search Widget:</strong> <br />Allows you to quickly search for assets and drag them directly on to the scene.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">Macros</h1>\n<p>The Alien system comes with 4 macros that will help you run the game smoothly. <br /><br />These can be found in the Compendium under Macro&gt;Alien.

There is little in the form of elevated terrain here, save for the massive alien hive structures that dominate the landscape.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Sector 117, orbiting Achilles Two</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Unclaimed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Planet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, hot and humid, perpetual twilight.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">40°C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Wasteland, shallow swamps and salty seas, minimal vegetation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Dozens of alien hive colonies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Unknown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Plagiarus praepotens</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":"D2b6SfDieYag0asd","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"3IXw5YyvjaVDm2Io":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3,"rS4UGcVJp4e6YrUz":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.mKDSlnPR7WFvcsuu"}}}
