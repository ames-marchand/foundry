EVENTS - ACT III","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">ACT III: DIVIDED WE FALL</h1>\n<p>In the final Act of the scenario, the PCs need to fight for their lives in the derelict ship, facing off against the corporate agents, Lucas, and the infected crew members, without knowing who is on their side and who is transforming into an Abomination. <br /><br />In this Act, the Personal Agendas of the PCs play out in full — especially for Lucas and Wilson — and what happens is largely determined by the players themselves. <br /><br />Here are some suggested events however:</p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">GOING HOME</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Thanks to the work of the PCs and/or NPCs, the engines of the <em>Cronus</em> come back online. <br />As soon as this happens, MU/TH/UR 2000 locks the ship on a course for Earth. A <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll reveals that the mainframe is under Special Order 966 to return the USCSS Cronus to Earth. <br /><br />No PC can override this order.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MEDICINAL PURPOSES</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Clayton asks the PCs to help bring the strain samples to Earth, explaining that this “primeval” Xeno­morph material is priceless, invaluable for research into cancer and a host of other serious diseases. <br /><br />And even if the 26 Draconis Strain cure is unstable, if it could be perfected, anyone encountering the spores would be safe. According to the translations the science team made, these creatures are not native to LV-1113 — they could be spread over countless worlds. </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MUTINY!</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>If the PCs resist Clayton and want to destroy the 26 Draconis Strain samples or even the <em>Cronus</em> itself, Clayton tries to bribe or persuade crew members to come to her side — especially Wilson, if he’s still alive — causing a mutiny among the survivors. <br /><br />Clayton uses <strong>MANIPULATION</strong> to have her way, using whatever leverage she can Clayton wants to accomplish a few things. She wants to get the 26 Draconis Strain syringes from the Medlab; get cash from the safe in her suite to bribe the crew with; retrieve her MCD cube, also in the safe; finally, she wants to load as many containers of Agent A0-3959X.91–15 as she can into her quarters using the EEV as an insurance policy. <br /><br />Clayton sends Wilson, or whomever else she’s cajoled to her side, to accomplish this. If none of this is possible, she at least wants one inoculation syringe full of the 26 Draconis Strain and an urn or vial from the Medlab or Science Labs so as to have something to return with. <br /><br />If things go bad, Clayton tries to kidnap Dr. Flynn and escape with as much as possible on the EEV.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">THE INFECTION SPREADS</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>While the PCs struggle with how to react to Clayton, more PCs are affected by the 26 Draconis Strain inoculation, turning more and more players into antagonists possibly until only a single unturned PC remains.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">PREPARE TO BE BOARDED</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A heavy clang against the hull tells the PCs that another ship has made contact and docked with the <em>Cronus</em>. <br />A system check confirms this. <br /><br />This is in fact the corporate-sponsored marauder ship <em>Sotillo</em>, whose signature might have been picked up earlier by the <em>Montero</em> or the <em>Cronus</em>. <br /><br />The <em>Sotillo’s</em> crew hung back for most of the scenario to see what’s going on; now they have chosen to board the <em>Cronus</em> and take her cargo, blasting their way through the airlock. They don’t wear compression suits, and they soon find out they got themselves into more than they bargained for. <br />If PCs have been killed or turned into Abominations, players can take over marauder characters to stay in the game. <br /><br />The crew of the <em>Sotillo</em> are described in <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[05. NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS]</span>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">WHO’S ON WHOSE SIDE NOW?</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>While Clayton tries to bribe the marauders into helping them, they aren’t too excited about the idea of these creatures getting loose on the Frontier. <br />Captain Bolaji weighs risk vs. a hefty paycheck before deciding whether to take Clayton, Wilson, and any xeno­morphic materials aboard the <em>Sotillo</em> or simply cut and run.<br />It’s unlikely the other PCs can convince the captain to rescue them, as they have no bargaining chip, but it might be possible for them to board the <em>Sotillo</em> and take it for themselves. <br />Inadvertently, the marauders' presence gives the PCs a fighting chance to survive, and their ship is the way out of this. <br />The Sotillo crew can of course be infected by Neomorphic Motes on the Cronus, and/or turn into Abominations if they take the inoculation.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CONTAMINATION PROTOCOL</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>In Act III, Lucas’s Personal Agenda is to use any means to stop Weyland-Yutani from getting their hands on the 26 Draconis Strain — meaning a direct confrontation between Lucas and Clayton is very likely. <br />Lucas might even try to sabotage or destroy the <em>Cronus</em> (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[C. CARGO DECK]</span> for information on how that can be done). <br />If the other PCs destroy Lucas’s physical body, he ceases to be a PC and turns into an NPC. He uploads himself to the mainframe of the <em>Cronus</em> and triggers a reactor overload. He freezes the locks on Clayton’s EEV. If the <em>Sotillo</em> has been introduced, the PCs' best choice may be to take the ship. It takes some work to release the locks on the EEV (a Turn of work and a <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>Note:</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">Only add the <em>Sotillo</em> to the mix if you feel the need for another twist in the story, want to make the scenario longer, or really need replacement PCs.

The company orders the crew to investigate under penalty of total forfeiture of shares. Finding a derelict ship, they discover an alien lifeform that threatens to kill them—and a member of the crew itself has a corporate directed agenda to protect it. <br />The particulars of this crime, however, are quite different. <br /><em> Chariot of the Gods</em> is a complete Cinematic scenario for the ALIEN roleplaying game. It’s designed to introduce the game to the players while at the same time take them for a thrilling, terrifying ride into space where no one can hear them scream. The scenario is designed for 3–5 players plus GM, and takes at least 4-5 hours to complete.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">CHARACTERS</h2>\n<p>This scenario comes with five pre-generated player characters—the crew of the USCSS Montero starfreighter. Filled-in character sheets for these PCs can be found in the Actors PC's section of the module. Let the players choose who they want to play. <br />If you have fewer than five players, the leftover crew members are NPCs under your control. <br />When your players have chosen their starting PCs, read <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"at7Vs915ifD5qP43\">WHAT'S THE STORY MOTHER?</a> out loud to the players. <br />Then show the players the map of the Montero and hand each player their Personal Agenda (see below) for the first Act to kick off the action. <br /><br />If any of the PCs should die during the course of the scenario, you can use NPCs from the crew of the USCSS Cronus or the Sotillo as replacements. Let the player choose a Buddy and Rival for their new character if they wish. For replacement PCs, use character sheets downloaded from the Free League website. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">GEAR:</strong> The PCs start the scenario with no personal gear except their signature items. As the scenario kicks off, the PCs may distribute the gear available on the Montero (see  <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"KqOP7BkTmTewzHlQ\">04. USCSS MONTERO</a> ) as they — or rather, Captain Miller — sees fit.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">PERSONAL AGENDAS</h2>\n<p>Each character has a Personal Agenda for each of the three Acts of the scenario. These Agendas are printed on playing cards included in this boxed set. At the start of each Act, give each player their new Agenda for the Act about to start, and <strong>tell them not to reveal it to the other players.</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> SPECIAL ORDER 966: </strong>At the start of the scenario, give Wilson's player the card entitled “Special Order 966” in addition to their Agenda.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> EVALUATING AGENDAS: </strong>At the end of each Act, collect the Agendas from the players and evaluate them individually. If you feel a player has actively advanced their PC’s Agenda despite significant personal risk or sacrifice, announce this and award them one Story Point (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"Ur3VsDVpi1zCKyXG\">PERSONAL STUFF</a>). <br />Don’t reveal the actual Agendas to the entire group, they should remain hidden until the end of the scenario.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\"> REPLACEMENT PLAYER CHARACTERS: </strong>Only original PCs have pre-written Personal Agendas for the three Acts of the scenario. NPCs used as replacement PCs have only one Agenda that remains the same for the entire scenario.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">THE SECRET ANDROID</h2>\n<p>One of the crew members on the Montero is in fact a synthetic undercover agent codenamed Lucas, working for Bionational—a corporate rival to Weyland-Yutani. <br />After the players have chosen PCs, decide which one of them is Lucas. When you hand out Personal Agendas, replace the chosen PC’s Agendas with Lucas’s Agendas. At the start of the scenario, give Lucas's player the card entitled “Note to Lucas” in addition to their Act I Agenda. Lucas can be an NPC if you prefer. <br /><br />To avoid detection, Lucas mimics human behavior to perfection. <br />As long as Lucas is not exposed, use rules for humans for the android—pushing rolls, gaining Stress Level, making Panic Rolls, etc. Only if Lucas suffers a critical injury is the android automatically revealed—as it bleeds white, not red. <br /><br />From the moment Lucas is exposed, it follows the rules for androids (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"O77NXruJ0vG2brzk\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>). <br /><br />When exposed, Lucas also shows its true power—the android's Strength and Agility increase by +3 each, also affecting Health, including current Health. Lucas's behavioral inhibitors are removed, allowing it to hurt humans. <br /><br /><strong> CALLING PVP.</strong> Revealing Lucas as an android has a high risk of triggering direct confrontations with other PCs. <br />If this happens, play out the current scene and then turn Lucas into an NPC, letting the player choose another character (someone from the crew of the Cronus) to play.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"YEoPmwinvi5w1FW6":3,"3SlHgCFcwdscgES2":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-cotg-scenario.DPwCTEi971M1bnZc"}}}

They can use specific skills, and then roll a number of Base Dice equal to their skill level only. Xenomorphs can have skill levels much higher than humans. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ARMOR RATING:</strong> Most Xenomorphs also have a thick hide, resistant to attacks, giving them a natural Armor Rating (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"EX2v5xgvfJJeySIC\">DAMAGE</a>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">HEALTH:</strong> When a Xenomorph is reduced to zero Health, it isn’t Broken in the way a human is.

Humans can only move two zones, i.e. they have a Speed of 1.</li>\n<li>In combat, a Xenomorph gets to act one time for each point of Speed in each Round.

It is believed that an ecological disaster there brought on by the release of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 in the atmosphere led to the accelerant settling on and mutating native fungal and insect life to produce a living nightmare. Similar to a Xeno­morph XX121, the Neomorph parasite (P. <em>celerius</em>) is delivered to a host via a carrier organism (<em>Tachinidae tabellarium</em>). Once implanted, the parasite gestates within a living host who is killed by the creature’s violent birth. There are a number of differences, however, causing the creature to be classified separately.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:</strong> Appearance - wise, Neomorphs are eyeless and have gray-white translucent skin, a fleshy spiked tail, an elongated bulbous head, and a sphincter-like facial orifice that distends to reveal a mouth full of cruel teeth. While their blood is translucent yellow like that of a Xeno­morph, it is not acidic. They make subtle clicking sounds and exhibit animal snarls and screeches, as well as making a distinct hooting sound as adults. Neomorphs are more animalistic than their Xeno­morph brethren and are clearly not as intelligent. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STAGES:</strong> A Neomorph’s life cycle is broken down into five known stages that are covered below, as well as various termination protocols associated with each stage. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STERILIZATION:</strong> Neomorphs are genetically programmed to kill all life. Believed by some to be a derivative of the black liquid, P. <em>celerius</em> was likely designed by the Engineers to clear a planet of any indigenous species still living after Agent A0-3959X.91-15 had wiped out the majority of a planet’s population.</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Small, bulbous pods that grow like fungus, the egg sacs are the result of the mutagenic Agent A0-3959X.91-15 interacting with pollen and microbial elements on a planet or in a spacecraft. Once formed, these bird’s egg-sized pods tend to grow in clutches of 2D6 — and there are often several clutches in any infected area. The egg sacs are the delivery system for the Neomorphic Motes (see Stage II). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best way to be rid of the Egg Sacs is to expose them to severe temperature changes — they can be destroyed with fire or made inert with liquid nitrogen (at least until they thaw). <br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE II: NEOMORPHIC MOTES</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>When the egg sacs are disturbed, they release what appears to be a puff of pollen. In reality, it is a synchronized swarm of highly infectious <em>Tachinidae tabellarium</em> motes, smaller than grains of sand. Possessing a primal hive intelligence, the motes target the nearest potential host and zero-in on an unprotected orifice such as the eyes, ears, nose, throat, or an open wound. From there they enter the bloodstream and inject microscopic amounts of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 into the victim’s white blood cells. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">INFECTION:</strong> Exposure to Neomorphic Motes is normally handled as a disease with Virulence 9. If the Sickness Roll fails, the patient enters Stage III within one Shift. No more Sickness Rolls are made.For the purposes of this Cinematic scenario, you are well within your rights to skip the roll and simply decide which PC or NPC is infected and enters Stage III and when, for maximum dramatic effect. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Neomorphic Mote tend to avoid smoke and are killed by fire.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE III: NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE IV: Neophyte (Juvenile neomorph)</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<p>Once the Motes enter a host’s bloodstream, they deliver their microscopic payload and die. The injected Agent A0-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall. This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass—such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster. <br /><br />If lodged in a region of the body with dense muscle or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host—using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew. The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster. <br /><br />Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours. These rabid quadrupedal creatures rely on their speed and agility to avoid damage. Emerging about 0.3 meters in length, Bloodbursters continue to grow exponentially, visibly getting larger as they move about. Highly aggressive, they lash out at anything and everything around them. They use their claws, tail, and teeth to savagely maul their victims. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> A patient entering Stage III is immediately killed outright by the birth of the Bloodburster. The newly born Bloodburster takes one Round to sluggishly free itself from its amniotic sack. As soon as it is free, it flies into a savage rage and attacks any living creature it encounters. See the table of signature attacks below. After just a few Turns, the Bloodburster enters Stage IV (juvenile Neomorph). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> As a slow action, the Bloodburster can sprint as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range from a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> The best bet is to attack a Bloodburster right after birth—before it has sluggishly freed itself from its amniotic sack (above). Fire or any serious damage done to the creature at this time causes it to run off and hide while it rapidly grows to its juvenile form.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>TYPICAL STATS <br />NEOMORPHIC BLOODBURSTER </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">SPEED:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">HEALTH:</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Mobility 9, Observation 6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">3 (zero against fire damage)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<p>Growing from 1.2 to 1.8 meters in length, a juvenile Neomorph continues to maneuver on all fours.

Feral and ferocious, a juvenile Neomorph uses its sharp-tipped tail and teeth to attack. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EVOLVING:</strong> After one Shift, the juvenile Neomorph enters Stage V and becomes an adult Neomorph. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> As a slow action, the Neomorph can sprint as if having used two run actions, i.e. through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range from a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Even when taking weapons fire, a juvenile Neomorph is so focused on the attack that it ignores damage to itself until it becomes critical.

When provoked, the adult Neomorph’s upper jaw protrudes in a manner similar to a goblin shark, allowing it to grasp prey and pull it in for the kill. As adults they utilize stealth tactics to hunt their prey, but they are still voracious carnivores. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SHORT LIFESPAN:</strong> The life cycle and meta­bolism of Neomorphs is so fast that they quickly burn themselves out. An adult Neomorph typically dies of natural causes within 24 hours (four Shifts). Fungus interacting with the decaying corpse will be transformed into new spore sacs, continuing the cycle. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Adult Neomorphs go down quick with a full burst from a pulse rifle, but any automatic weapon does the job eventually.

Once MU/TH/UR 2000 goes online and power is restored, the air scrubbers are activated and the ice melts. This chamber then becomes very noisy and it is difficult to hear anything — all <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> rolls get a –2 modification in here. <br />The air scrubbers work via electrolysis—electrical current is channeled through submerged rods and applied to the water, causing the separation of hydrogen and oxygen. That means that there is a real risk of electrocution in here once the power is back on. Any failed skill roll in here results in an immediate attack rolled with six Base Dice and Damage 1. The carbon filters on the air scrubbers are caked with decades of grime and mold, and just restoring power won’t be enough to return them to working order.

THE SITUATION","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">SCENARIO OVERVIEW</h2>\n<p>The starfreighter USCSS <em>Montero</em> is diverted to check out a distress signal sent by the USCSS <em>Cronus</em>, a science exploration ship that has been missing for three quarters of a century. The crew of the <em>Montero</em> investigate and find the few remaining <em>Cronus</em> crew in stasis and the ship overrun by alien creatures. As they attempt to transfer the survivors to the Montero, the starfreighter’s reactor is set to overload by one of the crew, who has orders to bring back the xeno­morphic materials the <em>Cronus</em> is carrying. With their ship destroyed, the <em>Montero</em> crew is forced to repair the <em>Cronus</em> instead. <br /><br />The crew soon finds themselves caught between corporate agents who put their mission and a paycheck ahead of human lives, the crew of the <em>Cronus</em> who are suffering from an infection that is slowly turning them into monsters, feral alien creatures that are out for blood, and a murderous android who wants to stop Weyland-Yutani from getting their hands on anything alien. Just when the <em>Montero</em> crew discover that they too might be infected, pirates attempt to seize the ship. It all comes down to one question — <em> does the crew want to stop a dangerous biological weapon from getting into the wrong hands, or do they want to become very, very rich? </em></p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE CRONUS?</h2>\n<p>Acting on classified data from an encrypted transmission, the Cronus was launched in 2110 to attempt to locate samples of Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91–15. <br />Deciphering part of the data transmission led them to the 26 Draconis system and a small planetoid dubbed LV-1113 tucked away in the planetary debris belt shared by the suns of this trinary star system. <br /><br />The chemical was discovered there, but some of it had been previously deployed, causing mutations in the planet’s lifeforms. <br />While the science team modified and experimented with what they called the 26 Draconis strain of the black liquid, members of the crew became infected with Mote pathogen spores, causing them to give birth to Bloodbursters which quickly matured into Neomorphs. <br /><br />Chaos soon broke out. <br /><br />There was a mutiny, the science module on the Cronus was ejected and left behind, and the surviving crew escaped the planetoid.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE 26 DRACONIS STRAIN: </strong> <br />Discovering that some among them had been infected by the spores before departing, the remaining scientists used a derivative of the 26 Draconis strain to inoculate the crew against the Neomorph spores. <br />The doctors administering it were unaware that their cure was not completely safe, however — nor that it could cause those inoculated to mutate into Abominations. <br />As some of the inoculated began to transform and others didn’t, the crew of the Cronus failed to make the correlation. Nonetheless, as the ship was overrun with Neomorphs and Abominations, they realized they were in over their heads. <br /><br />Barricading themselves on cryodeck and leaving the ship’s synthetic — Ava — to maintain the infested ship, they put themselves in stasis and hoped for a miracle. After being caught in a micro-meteorite storm, navigation control failed on the Cronus and her comms array was damaged. <br /><br />Ava was attacked by the Abominations while attempting to repair the engines. <br /><br />Life support failed, plunging the ship into a deep cold. <br /><br />The crew remained safe in their hypersleep chambers, and the creatures aboard went into a state of suspended animation. <br /><br />This all happened within two days of leaving LV-1113. Since then, the Cronus has been adrift, barreling along at sublight speeds for decades.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">MOTHER’S NOTE: </strong> <br />The 26 Draconis Strain inoculation works — 95% of the time it does indeed arrest the development of any Neomorph spores deposited by the Motes. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there is also a significant risk of the black liquid derivative going too far and recoding the DNA of the inoculated, slowly transforming them into zombie-like Abominations (see  <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-cotg-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"JA6vun1j3OwHEqSv\">09.

USCSS CRONUS","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">WEYLAND SEV M3 HELIADES-CLASS SCIENCE EXPLORATION VEHICLE</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Cronus</strong> is a science exploration vehicle launched at the beginning of the 22nd century. <br />Modern vessels in this design lineage are of the Magellan class, and a PC might mistake the ship for its newer brethren. <br />Just as the <strong>Montero</strong> is a slightly newer variant of the Nostromo, The <strong>Cronus</strong> is a variant of a Heliades-class ship with many similarities to the <strong>Prometheus</strong>. <br />On the <strong>Cronus</strong>, however, the separate Class D module was not a lifeboat, but instead a classified and specially-equipped science lab that could be jettisoned in the case of an emergency. <br />When the PCs encounter her, that module is missing, ejected at some point during the SEV’s original mission. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">AUXILIARY VEHICLES:</strong> The Cronus has only two ATVs (see page 141 of the core rulebook) in her vehicle bay, and is missing all of her Class A escape pods. Wherever she was, whatever she was doing, she left in a hurry — and left her vehicle complement behind. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE DECK PLANS:</strong> The Cronus has four decks, each accessible through main junction ladderways, two large elevators, and a staircase (that is collapsed). <br />You'll find the deck plans in the Scenes section of this module. <br />Each room or corridor is one zone for the purposes of movement (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"vNR0mDMUSCZfbcH8\">ACTIONS &amp; INITIATIVE</a>). <br />Larger rooms are divided into several zones, separated by thin lines. <br />The dotted lines are ventilation ducts, with larger dots marking zone limits.</p>\n<br /><br /><br />\n<p><img src=\"modules/alienrpg-starterset/maps/uscss-corvus-deck-a.webp\" /></p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><img src=\"modules/alienrpg-starterset/maps/uscss-corvus-deck-b.webp\" /></p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><img src=\"modules/alienrpg-starterset/maps/uscss-corvus-deck-c.webp\" /></p>\n<br /><br />\n<p><img src=\"modules/alienrpg-starterset/maps/uscss-corvus-deck-d.webp\" /></p>\n<br /><br /></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"m15WfhNxKpNOg2Js":3,"3SlHgCFcwdscgES2":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.pCOnrBkteDbP22tW"}}}
