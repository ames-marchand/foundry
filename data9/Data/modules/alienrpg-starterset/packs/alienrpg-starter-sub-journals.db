Located between the core systems and the Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast region of space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources. The Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the Colonial Navy operates there. <br />Past the Outer Rim is anyone's guess - and that thrill of the unknown is what draws pioneers here. <br />Settlers have likened the sometimes lawless Frontier to the Old West of the United States. Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds, atmospheric processors have been brought in to convert the air into something passably breathable. <br />The majority of settlers here are prospectors, entrepreneurs, farmers, and homesteaders. <br />Mining worlds refine ores and fuel, while agri and aquatic worlds harvest food and algae. Space stations such as Anchorpoint serve as a neutral staging ground for expeditions into deep space. Neighboring colonies don't always get along, and armed conflicts over stakes and claims are not uncommon - often requiring the Colonial Marines to step in and restore order. <br />The boundaries of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and sometimes colonies switch hands as border disputes redefine the map.</p>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">TERRITORIES OF THE FRONTIER</h2>\n<p>While dominated by the United Americas, the Frontier is an area intersected by several nation-states. An uneasy alliance exists between them, yet territorial disputes are not unheard of. What follows is a listing of the major government players vying for resources there. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THREE WORLD EMPIRE:</strong> <br />Consisting of the former United Kingdom, Japan, and several developing countries, the Weyland-Yutani corporation itself is a result of the formation of the Three World Empire - created when the UK company Weyland Corp merged with the Japanese Yutani Corporation. The Three World Empire pioneered space exploration, controls many long-established inner colonies, and only maintains a limited presence on the Frontier - allowing Weyland-Yutani to take the lead there. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE UNITED AMERICAS:</strong><br />Created in the early 2100s to compete with the expanding Three World Empire, the United Americas was formed by the merger of North, Central, and South America into one nation. The United Americas is a major colonizing and starfaring power, constantly expanding the Frontier. They operate both the Colonial Marines and the Colonial Navy - the most powerful peace-keeping forces on the Frontier. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE UNION OF PROGRESSIVE PEOPLES:</strong><br />The UPP is a powerful socialist block of systems that control a vast but resource poor sector of space. Formed from a coalition of countries that includes Russia and Vietnam, the UPP is the only government that is not influenced by corporate concerns - a fact that sometimes puts them in opposition to Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind in the arms race, the UPP still maintains a formidable fighting force. A state of cold war has existed between the United Americas and the UPP for decades, but with recent events on the Frontier, all that seems poised to change. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE INDEPENDENT CORE SYSTEM COLONIES:</strong><br />The ICSC is a loose conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each colony in the ICSC has its own government - many of which are corporate-owned. In addition to its operations within the colonies of the United Americas and the Three World Empire, Weyland-Yutani is known to maintain private interests in the ICSC - where they can conduct business as they see fit, far from the prying eyes of government control.</p>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 010:00.

Companies like Weyland-Yutani, BioNational, and Seegson are not limited by borders. In fact, they produce and control the technologies necessary for the continued existence of these star empires. The unwillingness of nation-states like the UPP to work with the private sector has left them behind in the space race.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> God at the Ass End of Space: </strong> <br />Life in the colonies is rough. After being promised a utopia, settlers instead found a frontier existence of drudgery in harsh environments. To that end, many have turned to God to get them through their daily rigors. While traditional religions are practiced throughout the colonies, sects of apocalyptic millenarian fundamentalists have arisen, as have fanatical cults and zealots driven by charismatic leaders in isolated areas. Recent years have seen the rise of fledgling organizations with questionable motives, such as the Practitioners of the Holy Immolation and the cultish Church of Immaculate Incubation.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"arpgtablesmall\" style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em style=\"color: azure;\">&ldquo;But how do you know?

Some scouts tell tales of priceless artifacts found in ancient ruins on distant moons - ruins that predate humanity by millennia. Others talk of derelict spacecraft - and a race of giants that once stalked the stars in them. Still others whisper about hostile lifeforms that overrun entire worlds - terrifying parasitic creatures that are beyond our comprehension and wholly alien. <br />Many believe Weyland-Yutani and other corporations are covertly developing new and dangerous biological weapons, ranging from plagues and drug-controlled psychopathic cyborgs to genetically-engineered monsters. If these weapons really are being developed, one has to wonder who the company is designing them for, and if a war is on the horizon. Over the past century, ships, stations, and even colonies have simply disappeared from the Frontier. Some attribute these losses to natural disasters or acts of God, others believe those involved fell prey to pirates or rival governments. Rumors of entire colonies being wiped out by a plague or nuked off the face of a planet have everyone on the Frontier living on the edge. Some even believe that man was never meant to leave Earth, and that space itself can swallow you whole. <br /><br />Shutter your storm blinds and seal the airlocks - something alien just might be out there, hiding in the dark. <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>It's waiting for you.</em></h3>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 015:09.

No one knows what hole Reed crawled into, and we can&rsquo;t go into the freezers without him. <br />I don&rsquo;t need this bullshit. </em></p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">HERE ARE THE FACTS</h2>\nThe year is 2183 - little more than three years since the destruction of the Hadley's Hope colony on LV-426, the disappearance of the USS Sulaco, and the closing of the prison and lead works on Fiorina 161. The loss of the Sulaco's Colonial Marine unit along with these Weyland-Yutani sponsored outposts, and the implications of corporate foul play stemming from these incidents, have created an air of distrust between the company and the United Americas. Many Frontier worlds have found themselves caught in the middle of this rift and have been forced to make do without either the supplies or defenses they need to survive. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> CREW EXPENDABLE:</strong><br />The only publicly made exposition of these events deals only with the aftermath on Fiorina 161. The book is titled Space Beast and is convict Robert Morse's alleged account of an alien \"dragon\" that overran the facility and brutally slew two dozen double-Y chromo inmates and their custodial staff. The book gives credence both to talk of monsters and to rumors of Weyland-Yutani experimentation with bioweapons - indicating they were more concerned about securing the creature for further study than saving lives. According to Morse, the hunt to capture the beast had spilled over from the incident on LV-426, and anyone who got in the Company's way was expendable - be they prisoners, soldiers, employees, or even colonists. Although banned instantly, copies of Space Beast have been transmitted illegally throughout the colonies. The book has developed a strong following. Some see it as a fantasy, a welcome diversion from their normal lives. Others have embraced Morse's story and built a millenarian cult around it - believing it to be a religious text and a portent of the Armageddon to come. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THIS TIME IT'S WAR:</strong><br />To add fuel to the fire, conflicts between the rival sectors of space have increased exponentially in the past five years. While unconfirmed, many believe that Hadley's Hope was a test site for one of Weyland-Yutani's bioweapons and that an enemy state sent a warship to nuke it from orbit. Others believe that the Company is working with a rogue nation to assume control of the colonies on the Frontier. As more and more Colonial Marine units are recalled and re-deployed to new campaigns, Frontier colonists are becoming scared. Without the military, there is no-one to protect them from pirates, hostile lifeforms, or invasion. To compensate, many colonies have enacted their own law systems, electing Marshals to oversee daily law enforcement. Some have even hired mercenary forces to protect their interests.\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>The 2180's are a dangerous time to be alive.</em></h3>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 019:47.

Originally developed by Weyland Corporation at the end of the 21st century, the MU/TH/UR system soon became the standard for running complex automated systems and facilities. Affectionately nicknamed &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; by the crews who utilize these computers, over the decades various models have sported different levels of AI packages. While both the MU/TH/UR 1000 and 9000 series are sophisticated interactive models that over time can develop rudimentary personalities, most military, cargo, and utilitarian craft of today are equipped with the standard 5000 through 8000 series. <br />While these machines can communicate through the ship&rsquo;s intercom system, most of them can only be directly accessed through the computer core. Card and punch code entry to this secure and static free chamber is only granted to the vessel&rsquo;s commanding officer. The computer core also allows the commanding officer to issue alternate commands and overrides to \"Mother&rsquo;s\" automated routine. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">A.P.O.L.L.O.:</strong> Seegson&rsquo;s answer to MU/TH/UR, A.P.O.L.L.O. was designed to coordinate Seegson&rsquo;s Working Joe synthetics to run a starship.

Weyland Corp scientists took optical disc media and enhanced it to the next level. The result is a nano-optical long-data memory disc. Called LDs, each disc can hold up to 10 zettabytes (ZB) of data. All colony and corporate records are backed up on these discs in case of an electromagnetic discharge.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MAGNETIC TAPES:</strong> A two-hundred-year-old technology, magnetic tape cassettes have become popular on the Frontier simply because they are both disposable and cheap. Utilizing sputter deposition technology, these cassettes can hold between 60, 90, or 120 terabytes (TB) of information each. While easily disrupted by a strong magnetic pulse, the benefit of magnetic tapes is that the archaic technology that runs them produces no easily detected wave signals. Most security sensor grids are set to detect more sophisticated electronic hardware. All these factors combined have managed to keep magnetic tapes in vogue for the past fifty years.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"crit\">DEVICE</td>\n<td class=\"heal\">WEIGHT</td>\n<td class=\"scol9\">COST</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">EFFECT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">Long-Data Disc</td>\n<td class=\"heal\">0</td>\n<td class=\"scol9\">$30</td>\n<td class=\"scol8\">Holds up to 10 zettabytes (ZB) of data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol4\">Magnetic Tape</td>\n<td class=\"heal\">0</td>\n<td class=\"scol9\">$5</td>\n<td class=\"scol8\">Holds up to 120 zettabytes (TB) of data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">DIAGNOSTICS AND DISPLAY</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">COMPUTER TERMINAL:</strong> A computer terminal is any colony, starship, or station based electronic hardware that can access and process data via keyboard or voice commands and monitor, or hologram. Using the right codes and <strong>COMTECH</strong> rolls at a terminal can potentially give you access to whatever MU/TH/UR or A.P.O.L.L.O. knows. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PR-PUT PORTABLE REMOTE PILOT UPLINK TERMINAL:</strong> A military-grade armored and water-resistant laptop, this portable terminal has a built-in piloting joystick. With the right skills (<strong>COMTECH</strong> roll) and access codes, you can use a PR-PUT to patch into a colony uplink tower and remote pilot an orbiting ship. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON C-SERIES MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDER:</strong> An &ldquo;old tech&rdquo; portable audio recorder used to record or play music and audio logs. Popular models include the classic C-24 ka-boombox and the just released portable C-60 &ldquo;spacewalk-man.&rdquo; Now when you go EVA you can bring your country blues with you (<strong>MANIPULATION</strong> +1). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SAMANI E-SERIES WATCH:</strong> A dual-faced precision wristwatch, each Samani E-series device is capable of telling the time and date for two synchronized colonial locations, allowing space travelers to keep track of time back home while they are in deep space. The latest addition, the E-550, includes oxygen and pressure sensors to warn its user of a hull breach (<strong>SURVIVAL</strong> +1). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PERSONAL DATA TRANSMITTER:</strong> These &ldquo;PDTs&rdquo; transmit the recipient&rsquo;s location. Some models also monitor vital signs. Most corporate sponsored Frontier worlds equip their colonists with PDTs in order to keep track of them in hostile environments. PDTs can be surgically implanted, built into a pressure suit, or worn as an accessory. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">IFF TRANSPONDER:</strong> A personal beacon that prevents automated sentry systems from accidentally blowing friendly targets to pieces. Usually surgically implanted before a campaign, the only flaws in the system are when their signal is disrupted and when an enemy gets their hands on a transceiver for infiltration purposes. How is this accomplished if IFFs are surgically implanted? You&rsquo;d be amazed what a good sharp knife can do. <br /><br /></td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DATA TRANSMITTER CARDS:</strong> DTCs are small clear plastic data transmitter cards that plug into a variety of recording equipment, such as the built-in visual and audio recorders on a space suit helmet. They wirelessly transmit data to the terminal they are synced to. Information captured by the device can be analyzed by a MU/TH/UR or A.P.O.L.L.O. system or displayed on a HoloTab. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON P-DAT:</strong> A personal data tablet, a P-DAT can be synced with Spectrograph Mapping Devices, PDTs, and helmet cams to coordinate a team on the go. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE:</strong> The SSDD is used to troubleshoot computer and mechanical systems aboard a space station or starship. A good engineer knows how to use one of these to hack doors and computer terminals&mdash;but you didn&rsquo;t read that here (<strong>COMTECH</strong> +2). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HOLOTAB:</strong> A high end strategic and analysis platform, a HoloTab&mdash;or Holographic Display Table&mdash;takes scanned live or recorded information fed to it and generates a three dimensional hologram of the subject. A HoloTab is usually used in conjunction with pre-existing maps or in coordination with PDTs and Parameter Uplink Spectagraph hardware (<strong>COMMAND</strong> and <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> +2). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MODULAR COMPUTING DEVICE:</strong> Perfected and manufactured by Weyland Corp in the 21st Century, a MCD is a high-end full audio/visual holographic projector.

Originally designed for rescue teams searching for civilians trapped in cave-ins and collapsed buildings, the tracker soon found use by the military fighting guerilla forces in extrasolar environments that made infrared impractical. You need to make a Power Supply roll after every use. Its battery has a Power Supply level of 5 when fully charged. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">M316 MOTION TRACKER:</strong> The drawback to the M314 is its size and weight&mdash;you can't fire your weapon and operate the tracker at the same time. An experimental pulse rifle mounted upgrade&mdash;the M316&mdash;is currently being field tested. The good news? It is compact, lightweight and easy to glance at in a firefight. Of course, with good news always comes bad. While the M316 operates about the same as the M314, it has a much more limited range&mdash;<strong>LONG</strong> outdoors and <strong>MEDIUM</strong> indoors. Your results may vary, but that&rsquo;s what you grunts are for&mdash;cannon fodder to help the big corporations figure out how to perfect their new toys.

A skilled user (requires a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll) can also use a neurovisor to communicate with the hyper sleeping subject, and an advanced user can use one to manipulate one&rsquo;s dreams&mdash;so the next time you go into hypersleep, keep those dreams clean&mdash;your supervisor could be watching. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">W-Y PARAMETER UPLINK SPECTROGRAPH MAPPING DEVICE:</strong> Sometimes called &ldquo;Pups,&rdquo; these cost-prohibitive mapping devices have been in use for a good hundred years. Pups employ limited anti-gravity propulsion to float through, across, and over otherwise difficult to navigate terrain. As these orbs scout about, they constantly scan a 360-degree area around the device with mapping lasers. The Pups then send the spectrograph information back to a synced device, usually a starship or ground-based HoloTab or a monitoring station in a mobile command vehicle. They can also detect lifeforms, atmospheric conditions, toxins, and more. Pups were given their nickname because they emit a haunting, hound-like howling sound as they seek and scan. They can scan one zone per Round, and detect any enemies in zones they pass.

The answer to space medicine, the Pauling MedPod is an autonomous medical scanner and surgical unit capable of performing bypass surgery. The Pauling MedPod can diagnose and treat infections through concentrated antibiotic injections. It can perform basic wound repair and pre-programmed surgical procedures such as an appendectomy, laparoscopic ablation and cesarean section. The Pauling MedPod has gone through several iterations. The newest model is the Pauling MedPod 1080i. Although still cost prohibitive, the 1080i is much more prolific than its 720i predecessor. All models of the Pauling MedPod feature an airtight operating shield, comfortable limb restraints, a laser scalpel, computer controlled robotic surgical arms, liquid spray anesthetic and vital signs sensors, all mounted on an adjustable titanium base. The MedPod can be programmed with a simple (+2) <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll and has a <strong>MEDICAL AID</strong> skill level of 10 (roll for the skill level only), but can&rsquo;t push its rolls. <br /><br /></td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">AUTODOC:</strong> Not everyone can afford a Pauling MedPod, but almost every ship, station, and colony has at least one AutoDoc.

Price varies from $5 for a pack of cigarettes to $60,000 for a kilo of benzoylecgonine. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">X-DRUGS:</strong> These are the more extreme drugs out there that most ethical corporations work to keep off their colonies. These X-drugs increase strength, endurance, and the senses, but prolonged use can result in severe side effects such as hallucinations, seizures, psychosis, and stroke. The Colonial Marine Corps is rumored to be experimenting with new powerful X-Stims for its soldiers, and some unscrupulous companies quietly supply their workers with similar illegal stimulants in an effort to increase productivity.

An M314 Motion Tracker, an Mk.50 Compression Suit, or an M41A Pulse Rifle can truly mean the difference between life and death for your character. You can find these items and plenty of other gear described in the Gear Chapter. You must write down all the items you are carrying on your character sheet. Write down one item per row in the Gear section on the sheet. If it&rsquo;s not listed on your sheet, you don&rsquo;t have it with you. In Cinematic play, the scenario determines what gear you start the game with.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng3\">SIGNATURE ITEM</h2>\n<p>In addition to your normal gear, you also have a signature item&mdash;a small item that&rsquo;s not of much practical use, but that has sentimental value to you and that says something about your character. <br />Common examples include a patch, a cap, or a photo of a loved one. <br />Once per Act in Cinematic play, and once per game session in Campaign play, you can interact with your signature item in some way to reduce your STRESS LEVEL (<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"FtMYEcJ7UARlH8ry\">STRESS &amp; PANIC</a>) one step. <br />Signature items are usually tiny (see below) and thus don&rsquo;t encumber you at all.</p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng3\">VEHICLES &amp; SPACESHIPS</h2>\n<p>In some Cinematic scenarios, your PCs have a vehicle or even a spacecraft. <br />Usually, vehicles and starships don&rsquo;t belong to one individual character&mdash;instead, they are crewed by the entire group of PCs together. <br />In Campaign play, it&rsquo;s also possible for your group to start out the campaign in possession of a vehicle or a ship. <br />This is explained in the full ALIEN roleplaying game core rulebook.</p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CONSUMABLES</h1>\n<p>In the world of ALIEN, you need to overcome a lot more than Xenomorph life forms to survive. Lack of air, food, water, and electric power can be just as deadly. These four resources are called consumables. You don&rsquo;t need to track consumables at all times. In the confines of a functional spaceship, orbital station or planetside colony, you likely have the consumables you need. The GM lets you know when resources are scarce and it&rsquo;s time to start tracking them. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"headng3\">SUPPLY:</h3>\n<p>You track each of the four consumables on your character sheet using a Supply rating. A higher rating is better. At regular intervals (see the table below), you need to make a Supply roll. This means rolling a number of Stress Dice equal to the current Supply rating, up to a maximum of six dice. For every <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;rolled, the Supply rating is decreased by one. When the Supply rating reaches zero, you&rsquo;re out of the consumable, and you&rsquo;re entering a world of hurt. <br />The effects of lacking air, food and water are explained in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"O77NXruJ0vG2brzk\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> Group Consumables:</strong> Usually, consumables are tracked individually, but they can also be tracked for the group as a whole, depending on the situation. <br />The GM has final say. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"headng3\">ENCUMBRANCE:</h3>\n<p>For encumbrance, your supplies of food and water count as one item each, as long as your current Supply rating is 4 or lower. See the table to the right. When your Supply rating hits zero for food or water, this consumable no longer encumbers you. Air and power don&rsquo;t usually count toward your encumbrance, as they are generally included in your pressure suit or other gear. <br />External air tanks or batteries can count as encumbering items however.

A regular item is generally the size of a small bag and weighs no more than a few kilos. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"headng3\">HEAVY &amp; LIGHT ITEMS:</h3>\n<p>An item designated as heavy counts as two regular items, and typically takes up two rows on your character sheet. Some heavy items count as three or even four normal items &mdash; the gear lists <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"y3lqEX8kuIvrSld2\">WEAPONS AND ARMOR</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"OKl6O6GULd7wEfUd\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a> indicate this.

They are so small they don&rsquo;t affect your encumbrance at all. The rule of thumb is: if the item can be hidden in a closed fist, it&rsquo;s tiny. Tiny items also need to be listed on your character sheet. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3 class=\"headng3\">OVER-ENCUMBERED:</h3>\n<p>You can temporarily carry up to twice your normal encumbrance limit, i.e. <strong>Strength</strong> x 4 items. If over-encumbered, you must make a <strong> MOBILITY</strong> roll when you want to run or crawl in a Round of combat (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-starter-sub-journals\" data-id=\"vNR0mDMUSCZfbcH8\">ACTIONS &amp; INITIATIVE</a>).

This is quite common in Cinematic play, less so in Campaign play. <br />In Cinematic play, it&rsquo;s up to the GM to call out when a Player versus Player situation escalates beyond the point of no return. &nbsp; When the GM has &ldquo;called PvP,&rdquo; the players involved play out the current conflict to its conclusion. After that, the PC who has &ldquo;turned traitor,&rdquo; if they are still alive, becomes an NPC and is from now on under the control of the GM. &nbsp; The player in question is given a new PC to play, if one is available. &nbsp; This means that you should think very carefully before acting against the common interests of the group, even if you think it&rsquo;s in line with your Agenda&mdash;it may cost you your PC.<br /><em> You are strongly recommended to wait until the third and final Act of the scenario before taking such drastic action.</em> <br /><br />In Campaign play, PvP is less common and any such situations are resolved in the group without specific rules&mdash;you&rsquo;ll just need to work out your differences if you are to continue in the same crew of PCs.</p>\n</div>"}

Stealth mode is played out in Turns. <br />In one Turn, you can move two zones on the map and explore them, scanning for enemies and getting a superficial description of these two zones from the GM. If you&rsquo;re a team, you can explore the map individually or as a group. <br />If you want to examine something in a zone more closely, such as accessing a data terminal, you need to stay one entire Turn (or even longer) in a single zone. <br />The GM has final say.</p>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">ENEMY MOVEMENT</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">DETECTION</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">In stealth mode, enemy movement is handled secretly by the GM. This is carried out each Turn, after your PCs have moved. NPCs must comply with the same rules of movement as PCs&mdash;human NPCs can only move two zones per Turn. Non-human characters may move faster or have other special rules. <br />To handle NPC movement, we recommend that the GM has a second copy of the conflict map, hidden from view by the GM Screen (available for purchase separately). On this map, the GM can place tokens to represent NPCs, hidden from the players&rsquo; view. <br />If your GM doesn&rsquo;t have access to a screen, she can simply track hidden NPC movement on a piece of paper. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ENEMIES:</strong> Enemies can be <strong>ACTIVE</strong> or <strong>PASSIVE</strong>, as dictated by the scenario or the GM. <strong>ACTIVE</strong> enemies are aware of you and are actively stalking you. <br /><strong>PASSIVE</strong> enemies are not aware of your presence and can be ambushed by you.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">In stealth mode, you will automatically detect <strong>PASSIVE</strong> enemies in the same zone or in line of sight (above).

You roll the dice when you perform a dramatic action that might determine if your PC lives or dies. <br />Both Base Dice and Stress Dice have the <span class=\"basesymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol on the 6 side.<br /><br />Rolling the <span class=\"basesymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol usually means that an effect of some kind is triggered, for example when succeeding at using a skill. <br /><br />Stress Dice also have the symbol <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;on the 1 side. <br /><br />Rolling the <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol triggers panic in your character. How all this works in detail, you will learn in the Skills Chapter. <br /><br />NOTE: <em>You can play this game with any normal six-sided dice, but it helps if you have them in two different colors to tell Base Dice and Stress Dice apart.</em> <!-- ROLLING DICE\n        The rules sometimes ask you to roll D6, D3, 2D6 and D66. D6 means rolling a Base Die and reading the number, ignoring any symbols. D3 means you roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up. 2D6 means you roll two D6 and add the results.

CAPTAIN CHARLIZE RECORDING. We still can&rsquo;t find Reed. We split up into teams and searched deck by deck&mdash;nothing. Maybe he went into the cargo crawl space and is in the refinery for some reason. </em></p>\n<br />\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">FRONTIER COLONISTS</h2>\n<p>To most, becoming a colonist means you accept a hard life with little reward other than the satisfaction of a job well done. A colonist's hands are always dirty and their feet are always tired. Living on the edge of civilization can have its benefits, however. Depending on your profession, the chance to strike it big could be right around the corner. Frontier Colonists are scouts and homesteaders, farmers and scientists, miners and doctors. Colonial Marshals keep the peace and Frontier journalists keep the colonies in the know. Colonists are the lifeblood of humanity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">SPACE TRUCKERS</h2>\n<p>While not as lucrative a field as it was some fifty years ago, hauling refineries and cargo between Earth and the colonies is still big business. The advent of newer and faster FTL drives has significantly shortened the travel time between worlds, ensuring that starship crews don't have to spend nearly as much time in stasis. Most companies compensate their crews not only for their work but for time lost in hypersleep as well. While most space truckers work for one corporation or another, there are also independent trader captains, smugglers, salvage crews, and privateers. Space is big and, legally or off the books, people and things always need to get from one side of it to the other.</p>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">COLONIAL MARINES</h2>\n<p>The United States Colonial Marine Corps represents the finest fighting force ever assembled. Technologically advanced and sporting all the latest in military hardware - a large amount of which is designed by Weyland-Yutani - the Colonial Marines are able to operate independently in nearly any environment. Combat teams are cross-trained and can be deployed at a moment's notice to nearly any world without extensive briefing. Military occupations include vehicle operators and pilots, combat technicians, heavy weapons specialists, medics, engineers, and career officers. Naval occupations are found in the USCM support service of warship and starfighter teams of the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet, and there are special military R&amp;D programs across the spectrum that require volunteers. On the Frontier, there is always something that needs defending and some planet that needs pacifying.</p>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">COMPANY REPS</h2>\n<p>Corporations have more power than governments on the Frontier. They own worlds, set up shop, and bring in the colonists, creating homes and jobs. From CEOs to field agents, each company sends out its own representatives to oversee their business ventures. Companies like Weyland-Yutani have been known to employ their own commando security teams, doctors, and scientists as well. Also, there is big business in knowing your competitors' next move - so many corporations have their own counterintelligence personnel embedded in rival companies and governments. Being a company rep is all about the art of the deal and making sure the little people around you do their jobs so that you can make your next promotion.</p>\n</div>","_id":"uQtNSt3CYFbTshSQ"}

The GM puts her initiative cards in front of her. <br />When all the participants in the combat have acted once, the Round is over, and a new Round begins.

You can achieve this in several different ways. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SNEAK ATTACK:</strong> When you stalk someone and your attack catches them unawares, it&rsquo;s called a sneak attack. First, roll your <strong>MOBILITY</strong> versus your target&rsquo;s <strong>OBSERVATION</strong>. You get a modification depending on how close you want to go. See the table to the right. <br />If you want to attack in close combat, you usually have to move to within <strong>Engaged</strong> range of your enemy. If you fail, your opponent spots you at your starting distance&mdash;draw initiative.<br />If you succeed, you get a free action (slow or fast, but not both) before you draw the initiative. Your target cannot block a sneak attack. Sneak attacks are always done individually, by one attacker against one target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">AMBUSH:</strong> A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush. <br />You lie in wait for your enemy and attack when they come close. When you ambush someone, you roll <strong>MOBILITY</strong> as described above, but with a modification of +2, since it is the target and not the attacker that is moving. Ambushes can be carried out by a group and against a group of targets. <br />This follows the usual rules for stealth&mdash;the character with the lowest <strong>MOBILITY</strong> skill level rolls for the attackers, while the target with highest <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> skill level rolls for the targets.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"><strong> SNEAK ATTACKS &amp; AMBUSHES </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"ehead\">\n<td class=\"scol1\">RANGE</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">MODIFICATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">&ndash;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Short</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">&ndash;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Medium</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Long</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Extreme</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

Firing a weapon is a slow action. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">AIMING:</strong> If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. Aiming is a fast action. If you do anything else except shoot your weapon after you have aimed, or if you are hurt, you lose the effect of the aim and you need to spend another fast action to aim again. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RANGE:</strong> The weapons tables in the Gear Chapter indicate the range of each weapon, i.e. the maximum range category at which the weapon can be used. The farther away your target is, the harder it is to hit. At Medium range you get a &minus;1 modification, and at LONG range you get &minus;2.

This means that you aim in the specified direction and are ready to shoot. Between the time you assume the overwatch position and your time to act in the next Round, you can fire your weapon against a target in the chosen direction. <br /><br />You can fire whenever you want in the turn order, and your shot is resolved before all other actions &mdash; even if they are already declared. <br />For example, if an enemy in the direction you are aiming declares that they want to fire a weapon, you can shoot first. The enemy is not allowed to change their attack after your overwatch attack. <br />Firing when in overwatch position counts as a normal attack (a slow action). Therefore, you must save your slow action in the Round for any overwatch attack you want to make.

Remaining ammo is tracked via an LED counter and the rifle has two firing modes—burst and full automatic. For more about the grenade launcher, see the U1 below. An otherwise reliable weapon, the M41A can jam when fully-loaded, so partially loaded magazines are recommended. (In their downtime on mission Marines will take the time to remove a few rounds from each of the magazines they carry.)

All humans in the target zone must make a hard STAMINA roll (–2, doesn’t count as an action) or be stunned for one Round. <br />@Compendium[alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-weapons-items.y0iqlWeXIxnhkjxH]{G2 Electroschock Grenade}  </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"bigtable\"><caption>\n<h2 class=\"headng\">CLOSE COMBAT WEAPONS</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"strhead\">\n<td class=\"crit\">WEAPON</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">BONUS</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">DAMAGE</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">RANGE</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">WEIGHT</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">COST</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">COMMENT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fat\">Unarmed Attack</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor doubled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fat\">Blunt Instrument</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">+1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fat\">Knife</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1/2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$50</td>\n<td class=\"tim\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fat\">Stun Baton</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">+1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1/2</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$80</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Stun effect, Power Supply 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"fat\">Cutting Torch</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">-</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">3</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">1</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">$300</td>\n<td class=\"tim\">Armor piercing, Power Supply 5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STUN BATON:</strong> Basically a cattle prod, these electroshock devices are designed to keep pests and livestock in order on the Frontier. While the charge isn’t strong enough to kill a human, a touch can incapacitate the target. If you see something lurking underfoot, hit it with it. Shouldn’t damage the little bastard, unless its skin is thinner than ours… Anyone hit by a stun baton who takes one or more points of damage must make an immediate <strong>STAMINA</strong> roll (doesn’t count as an action) or be stunned for one Round. After each attack, you need to make a Power Supply roll.

Most military smart guns won’t fire when turned on a target along the outer hull of a safe-sensor equipped ship. Civilian weapons aren't quite so clever. Your best bet is to keep ‘em holstered until you’ve exhausted all other options.

The armor protects against edged weapons and glancing blows from high powered ammunition. It has a built-in comm unit and Personal Data Transmitter, combat webbing straps to connect a variety of equipment, and contact points which monitor the wearer’s vitals and transmit them to a tactical monitoring station. Armor Rating 6. <br />@Compendium[alienrpg-starterset.alienrpg-ss-armor-items.wEYcFHXgKMvYzqEf]{M3 Personnel Armor}  <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IRC MK.50 COMPRESSION SUIT:</strong> State of the art when it was introduced six decades ago, the reliable Mk.50 compression suit is still a common sight on the Frontier. The sturdy helmet has a comm unit and heads-up display, a lateral head light, and a wireless helmet cam that syncs to any mobile or stationary monitoring system. The suit carries a healthy supply of oxygen and maintains internal pressure for its wearer while in a vacuum. If you are going to get blown out into space, you want to be in a Mk.50.

You want to be careful wearing one of these in a fight, as the hard joints tend to seize up with extreme motion. While the inexpensive suit offers full protection from the vacuum of space, you have to spend time in a decompression chamber after spacewalking in one. Basically, this suit sucks, but if the choice is a Mk.35 or the cold of space, shut up and suit up. Armor Rating 5, Maximum Air Supply 4.

The helmet has a sophisticated heads-up display built in, and the suit has its own thrusters for tether-free zero-G maneuvers. The comm array on a standard Eco EVA Suit is unshielded, and thus sensitive to rogue transmissions. Armor Rating 4, Maximum Air Supply 6.

While an APEsuit cannot protect you from the vacuum of space, it does offer a filtered air supply, limited armor, resistance to temperature extremes, and is impervious to caustic substances. The helmet includes protective eyewear and a mask to protect the wearer’s face. The suit is commonly worn by Weyland-Yutani’s security commandos and “Dog Catcher” units to contain hostile organisms, so if you see a bunch of guys show up wearing these, get the hell out of there—because what they are looking for just might find you.

The exosuit amplifies your strength tenfold and is equipped with hydraulic claws for lifting and grasping. A roll cage protects your face while you operate one, and a webbed harness keeps you strapped in in case you take a tumble. The P-5000 is difficult to master, but a pro can make operating it seem as simple as walking. Many variants exist, including a weaponized version and a wheeled work loader for larger loads.
