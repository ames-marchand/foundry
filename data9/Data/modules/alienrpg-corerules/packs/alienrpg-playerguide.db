I&rsquo;d confine everyone to quarters, but we&rsquo;re getting abnormal readings from the engines. Nat and Ellery are checking it out.&emsp;</em></p>\n<br />\n<p>The ALIEN roleplaying game can be played in two distinct modes: Cinematic play and Campaign play. These modes are each designed to create a different experience for you. Even some rules of the game only apply to one of the two game modes&mdash;such rules are marked with the symbol of each game mode (see below).</p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\"><span class=\"cinsymbol\"> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;CINEMATIC PLAY</h1>\n<p>A Cinematic scenario emulates the dramatic arc of an ALIEN film. Designed to be played in a single session, this game mode emphasizes high stakes and fast and brutal play. Conflict between player characters is likely, and you are not all expected to survive. <br /><em>In fact, most of your PCs probably won't live to see the end of the scenario. </em> </p>\n<p>For a quick taste of Cinematic gameplay, see Hope's Last Day.</p>\n<p><br />More Cinematic scenarios will be published by Free League Publishing in the years to come.</p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\"><span class=\"camsymbol\"> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;CAMPAIGN PLAY</h1>\n<p>Campaign play is designed for longer continuous play with the same cast of player characters over several game sessions, perhaps even dozens of sessions. <br /><br />In Campaign play, you create your own PCs, using rules in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"ZlRzzSKPqQB79iZ7\">YOUR CHARACTER</a> <br />Campaign play can also be brutal and deadly, but the chances for your PCs to survive a night of play are generally higher than in Cinematic play. <br />In Campaign play, the narrative of the game is to a higher degree controlled by the GM and the players themselves. <br />You decide where to go and what to do, based on who your PCs are and what they want. <br /><br />This core book of the ALIEN roleplaying game supports three different campaign frameworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Space Truckers</li>\n<li>Colonial Marines</li>\n<li>Frontier Colonists</li>\n</ul>\nThese campaign frameworks, and tools for how to run them, can be found in the GM Guide, along with the NOVGOROD STATION scenario location.<br />Sourcebooks and other supplements for Campaign play will be published by Free League in the years ahead.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CnrW4G4ZnTHuAkok":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.qX4IAPVQybIwuLf2"}}}

Roll the attack like you would if you were ramming a person. The damage from your attack is inflicted on the enemy vehicle.

When moving, you distribute the zones moved on vertical and horizontal movement. When on the ground, the Speed of aerial vehicles is typically 1. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CRASHES:</strong> If an aerial vehicle is Wrecked, it crashes violently to the ground. All people inside suffer damage equal to the altitude (in zones) multiplied by 3.

Without the protection of a space suit or the hull of a ship, you won&rsquo;t last long in the black void. If your ship suffers explosive decompression (below) or if you are thrown out of an airlock, your life is in extreme danger. The absence of pressure creates gas bubbles in your blood, causing your whole body to swell up. This results in crippling pain, all while the raw UV radiation from the nearest star sears your skin. You can&rsquo;t hold your breath&mdash;if you do, your lungs collapse. After that, you are just moments away from death. <br />You must make a <strong>STAMINA</strong> roll every Round without protection in a vacuum. The test doesn&rsquo;t require an action, but you must roll it before doing anything else in the round. The roll is unmodified for the first Round, but you get a &ndash;1 modification for the second Round. In the third Round you get &ndash;2, and so on. A failed roll means you drop directly to zero Health and must make a Death Roll every Round until you die or you enter a pressurized area. You don't suffer a critical injury. <br />Before going unconscious, you should put all your efforts towards getting a space suit on, if one can be found nearby.

The air in the room will vent out into space in a Turn, and the intense draft will require everyone to make a <strong>STAMINA</strong> roll to perform any action (the <strong>STAMINA</strong> roll itself counts as a fast action). <br />Most ships will automatically seal off a breached compartment.

Until the android suffers a System Shutdown, it can continue to operate, only suffering the effects of the critical injury. This makes androids very hard to stop. Each further attack inflicting damage on a Broken android will inflict another critical injury. If you roll the same critical injury again, shift it down one step on the table (from a 4 to a 5, for example). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">REPAIRS:</strong> Androids don&rsquo;t heal.

They can repair themselves. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DEATH:</strong> Androids don't make Death Rolls and cannot &ldquo;die.&rdquo; If they suffer a System Shutdown they can be reactivated to communicate with. This requires a power source, a Turn of work, and a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll. An android &ldquo;revived&rdquo; in this way can be repaired (above) to working order, but it will suffer a permanent mental trauma. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RESOURCES:</strong> Synthetics don&rsquo;t need air, food, water, or sleep.

More information for the GM can be found in the Chariot of the Gods scenario. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MULTIPLE ACTIONS:</strong> Some Xenomorphs get to act twice or even three times in a Round.

Human life is cheap and so are paychecks. There is always someone worse off, willing to do your job for even less, so you better not screw up and lose the one you have. In most professions, having dirt on your employer or becoming a certified expert in a field are the only ways to maintain any semblance of job security. <br /><br />Aside from the luxury accommodations of the corporate elite and the cutting edge weapons of the Colonial Marines, almost everything is grimy, used, and in need of repair. The only colonists guaranteed to receive new parts and equipment are the miners and atmospheric processor support personnel on planets consistently exceeding their corporate quotas. In remote sectors, imported technologies are overpriced and hard to come by, so most equipment is jury-rigged, modified, and made from recycled and refurbished materials. In some territories, vehicles and starships are still in use that are nearly a century old. <br /><br />Instead of the expensive, three dimensional holographic displays of yesteryear, most spacecraft are equipped with conventional monitors and basic sensor packages. <br /><br />Over the past several decades, MU/TH/UR computer systems have become less about the sophistication of the AI and more focused on utilitarian function. Even spacesuits are bulkier and provide less protection than those produced during the golden years of space exploration. <br />In essence, humankind as a technological society is on the decline. <br /><br />Humanity never would have left the cradle of our solar system without the foresight of visionary entrepreneur and businessman Peter Weyland. Under his stewardship, the Weyland Corporation introduced three things that ensured humanity&rsquo;s dominance over the stars&mdash;the capacity to travel at faster than light speeds, the introduction of the hypersleep chamber, and the ability to terraform whole worlds.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">HYPER SLEEPING WITH THE STARS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">The ability to travel faster than light is the lynchpin of humanity&rsquo;s expansion outside our own solar system. Without it, there would be no extrasolar colonies and no corporate star empires. First developed by Weyland Industries in the 2030s, these engines are sometimes referred to as displacement drives. The system works on the principle of an inverse relationship between velocity and the flow of time. <br />An FTL drive achieves these speeds by displacing the volume of space preceding a spacecraft and drawing the vessel forward with it. Accelerating to faster than light speeds is not instantaneous. Ion thrusters build speed up to the point where the displacement drive can take over, gradually propelling starships to several times the speed of light. <br /><br />When they were first deployed a hundred and fifty years ago, FTL engines could impel a starship such as a Heliades class Space Exploration Vehicle at 10 to 15 times the speed of light. Even though modern ships can travel from 50 to upwards of 700 times FTL (read more in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"O1MgVzxS6FMgCv6m\">SPACECRAFT BASICS</a>), that still means it can take weeks or even years to travel the whole of charted space. <br /><br />To complicate matters, prolonged travel at faster than light speeds can cause a syndrome in mammals known as Neurological Distortion Disorder&mdash;or the NDDs for short (see the text above). To combat this and to conserve resources on long trips, space travelers spend most of their FTL time in stasis.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Even before FTL was possible, hypersleep technology was in development. As early as the 2020s, Peter Weyland had ordered his scientists to find a way to extend life indefinitely. While not exactly what Weyland had in mind, the resulting technology was a significant leap forward. The ability to slow a life-form&rsquo;s biological processes to a near standstill was beneficial to both the medical industry and deep space missions at sublight speeds. When FTL became a reality, stasis was adapted as a solution to resource management on space flights. Hypersleep was soon found to offer other benefits to man&rsquo;s health in space. Traveling faster than the speed of light can have a distortion effect on human perception. Known as Neurological Distortion Disorder, this syndrome causes paranoia, epilepsy, psychotic behavior and other adverse effects. Worse than that, the faster one travels, the worse the symptoms. Stasis protects space travelers from the NDDs, with the added benefit of arresting aging on a cellular level. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE SLEEP OF AGES:</strong> The process of entering hypersleep involves a mixture of gases and lowering one's temperature significantly. While travelers are not conscious when in stasis, they can&mdash;and are encouraged to&mdash;dream. As brain functions are also slowed during hypersleep, a single dream can last months. In fact, an entire industry has been created to take advantage of this (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"fAIBrPSBBJG0hSgM\">LIVING IN SPACE</a>). Dreaming in hypersleep promotes mental health and can help a body&rsquo;s natural regenerative healing. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RULES:</strong> After a number of days of FTL travel equal to the FTL rating of the ship (a lower rating means a faster ship), roll a D6 on the table below. When the same number of days have passed again, roll again adding +1 to the roll. Keep rolling with the same frequency, each time adding an additional +1 to the roll. As stated above, stasis offers protection from the NDDs, but being abruptly awakened from hypersleep is dangerous. Disorientation, headaches, chest pain, and nausea are all common side effects. While uncommon, some severe cases have resulted in death. In game terms, a rude awakening from hypersleep counts as an attack against you rolled with six Base Dice. Should you be Broken by this damage, you must make a Death Roll every Turn. In addition, hypersleep for any length of time will make you Dehydrated (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"5Oda1OfYXdSrZqaO\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>). The Hydr8tion drug (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"e6QATvQ6bdRW8iW6\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>), taken before stasis, will counteract this effect.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption>\n<h2 class=\"headng\">NEUROLOGICAL DISTORTION DISORDER</h2>\n</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"strhead\">\n<td class=\"die\">Roll</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"scol6\">EFFECT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">-5</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"scol6\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">NO EFFECT.</strong> Yet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">6-7</td>\n<td class=\"scol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"scol6\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PARANOIA.</strong> You become convinced that someone or something on board the ship is out to get you.

The details of this process and the principles behind it are currently classified by Weyland-Yutani. <br />Still in experimental trials, Gravity Drives are mostly unknown on the Frontier, found only on high-end company yachts and exploration ships hailing from the Core Systems. <br /><br />A fortuitous byproduct of the gravity drive is that the fields generated by it provide powerful protection against ballistic and energy attacks.

A lower number means a faster ship. Presently, no existing ship has an FTL rating lower than 1. To calculate your journey, multiply the number of days per parsec by the number of parsecs. <br /><br />For example: If you have an FTL drive with a rating of 6 and you are traveling 9 parsecs, you wind up with a trip that takes 54 days. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">OVERCHARGING ENGINES:</strong> Need to get somewhere in a hurry? Your engineer might be able to coax more speed out of your engines.

These materials provide enough strength for massive acceleration, while remaining flexible enough to withstand atmospheric entry for ships with planetfall capacity. The structural strength of a spaceship is measured by its Hull rating, which in turn determines how much damage it can take before becoming Disabled (see Hull Damage: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"SbHl8ELRtb3a5GyR\">SPACE COMBAT</a>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ARMOR:</strong> Exterior ship bulkheads are typically fitted with laminated insulators, micrometeorite shielding, composite material, and aerogel. Military ships tend to have heavier armor than civilian vessels, but a direct hit from a railgun will slice through any ship armor invented. The armor of a spaceship is measured by its Armor Rating, which works in a similar way as armor on vehicles or personnel (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"gyx2HlF4IpOS5f5A\">DAMAGE</a>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">BRIDGE:</strong> The bridge is the brain of the ship.

Military ships typically use powdered lithium hydride as fuel, while civilian vessels use heavy hydrogen isotopes like deuterium and tritium. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SUBLIGHT THRUSTERS:</strong> Sublight propulsion is generated by rocket motors, powered directly by the fusion reactor. Reaction mass such as industrial carbon diamond is simply placed in contact with the fusion plasma, which heats it. The heated gas is then expelled via the rocket motors. The Thrusters rating of your ship functions as a bonus to your <strong>PILOTING</strong> skill. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DISPLACEMENT DRIVES:</strong> <br />Faster-than-light propulsion is provided by a tachyon shunt hyperdrive powered by the reactor, accelerating the vessel past the light barrier.

As opposed to internal modules, however, armaments are mounted on external hardpoints. Each ship can only be fitted with a specific number of armaments of each size. It&rsquo;s possible to fit a smaller armament into a slot for a bigger one, but not the other way around. <br /><br />Damage from ship armaments works in the same way as personal weapons, but the scale is different. Ship armaments can&rsquo;t be used to target individuals.The weapons described below are listed in the table to the below, which also includes prices. More ship armaments will be described in future modules. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ASAT MISSILES:</strong> The typical main armament of military frigates, guided ASAT missiles have long range and pack a heavy punch. Their main drawback is that they take some time to reach their target, giving it a chance to shoot the missile down or deploy countermeasures. A missile battery can typically fit eight missiles. Individual missiles must be purchased separately. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RAILGUN:</strong> This close defense weapon uses superheated plasma to fire heavy metal rounds at extremely high speed, slicing through a ship&rsquo;s armor like butter. Railguns are not very accurate but extremely deadly at short range. All armor counts as half (round up) against railguns. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PARTICLE BEAM WEAPON:</strong> These weapons accelerate particles in a kinetic energy wave that causes damaging ionization, and can overheat electronics to the point of shutdown. Particle beam weapons function differently from other ship armaments. <br />First, countermeasures have no effect against them. <br />Second, their base Damage rating is reduced one step for each range category beyond <strong>CONTACT</strong>. <br />Third, they inflict no hull damage, only component damage.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ORBITAL MINES:</strong> Cheap and very effective against unwanted boarding parties, orbital mines are a cost-effective short-range weapon. Individual mines must be purchased separately. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TACTICAL NUKES:</strong> Shipborne nukes are deployed from orbit to destroy planetary based targets, even entire colonies. A 50-megaton nuke will completely destroy all buildings and kill all living beings within a 10 km radius, and cause damage to buildings and people up to 100 km away from the center of detonation. In addition, a high-altitude detonation will create an electromagnetic pulse that destroys unshielded electronics. A nuclear missile battery can typically fit five missiles. Individual missiles must be purchased separately. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CIWS LASER ARRAY:</strong> The defensive countermeasure CIWS &mdash; Close in Weapons System &mdash; is a laser array designed to target and shoot down incoming missiles, and even railgun rounds. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SENSOR DRONES:</strong> When launched, sensor drones create false sensor signatures that can maneuver at speed and can lure away incoming missiles and railgun targeting systems. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SENSOR DECOYS:</strong> These devices register false radar signatures to confuse weapons. <br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>REWORKING YOUR SHIP</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">To mount new modules or armaments to your ship, or to make upgrades to it, you&rsquo;ll need to find a dry dock on a major space station or planetside colony.

An M314 Motion Tracker, an Mk.50 Compression Suit, or an M41A Pulse Rifle can truly mean the difference between life and death for your character. You can find these items and plenty of other gear described in the Gear Chapter. You must write down all the items you are carrying on your character sheet. Write down one item per row in the Gear section on the sheet. If it&rsquo;s not listed on your sheet, you don&rsquo;t have it with you. In Cinematic play, the scenario determines what gear you start the game with. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">STARTING GEAR:</strong> In a Cinematic scenario, the scenario determines what gear you start the game with. In Campaign play, your career determines what gear you can choose from at the start of the game. <br />If you get a weapon, you always get two full reloads to go with it. <br />In addition to the items you choose, you are assumed to have a uniform or civilian clothing. <br />You also get some cash&mdash;the career indicates how much. <br />Read more about cash and how to spend it in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"7a6DDRe6jVF8nzut\">A HARD LIFE AMONGST THE STARS</a>. </p>\n<br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SIGNATURE ITEM:</strong> In addition to your normal gear, you also have a signature item &mdash; a small item that&rsquo;s not of much practical use, but that has sentimental value to you and that says something about your character. <br />Signature items are usually tiny (see below) and thus don&rsquo;t encumber you at all. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">VEHICLES &amp; SPACESHIPS:</strong> In some Cinematic scenarios, your PCs have a vehicle or even a spacecraft. Usually, vehicles and starships don&rsquo;t belong to one individual character &mdash; instead, they are crewed by the entire group of PCs together. <br />In Campaign play, it&rsquo;s also possible for your group to begin the campaign in possession of a vehicle or a ship.

A regular item is generally the size of a small bag and weighs no more than a few kilos. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HEAVY &amp; LIGHT ITEMS:</strong> An item designated as <em>heavy</em> counts as two regular items, and typically takes up two rows on your character sheet. Some heavy items count as three or even four normal items&mdash;the gear lists in Gear sections indicate this. <br />At the opposite end of the spectrum, there are items that are designated as <em>light</em> &mdash; they count as half of a regular item, and so you can list two light items on one row on your sheet. Some light items count as a quarter of a normal item in terms of encumbrance &mdash; the weight of such items is written as &frac14; in the gear lists. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TINY ITEMS:</strong> Items that are even smaller than light items are called <em>tiny</em>. They are so small they don&rsquo;t affect your encumbrance at all. The rule of thumb is: if the item can be hidden in a closed fist, it&rsquo;s tiny. Tiny items also need to be listed on your character sheet. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">OVER-ENCUMBERED:</strong> You can temporarily carry up to twice your normal encumbrance limit, i.e. <strong>STRENGTH</strong> x 4 items. If over-encumbered, you must make a <strong>MOBILITY</strong> roll when you want to run or crawl in a Round of combat (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"ssjoY80R65tghqBa\">ACTIONS &amp; INITIATIVE</a>). If you fail, you must either drop what you are carrying, or stay put. <br /><br /></p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CONSUMABLES:</h1>\n<p>In the world of ALIEN, you need to overcome a lot more than Xenomorph life forms to survive. Lack of air, food, water, and electric power can be just as deadly. These four resources are called consumables. You don&rsquo;t need to track consumables at all times. In the confines of a functional spaceship, orbital station or planetside colony, you likely have the consumables you need. The GM lets you know when resources are scarce and it&rsquo;s time to start tracking them. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SUPPLY:</strong> You track each of the four consumables on your character sheet using a Supply rating. A higher rating is better. At regular intervals (see the table below), you need to make a Supply roll. This means rolling a number of Stress Dice equal to the current Supply rating, up to a <em>maximum</em> of six dice. For every <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;rolled, the Supply rating is decreased by one. When the Supply rating reaches zero, you&rsquo;re out of the consumable, and you&rsquo;re entering a world of hurt. <br />The effects of lacking air, food and water are explained in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"5Oda1OfYXdSrZqaO\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>. <br /><br /><strong> Group Consumables:</strong> Usually, consumables are tracked individually, but they can also be tracked for the group as a whole, depending on the situation. <br />The GM has final say. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ENCUMBRANCE:</strong> For encumbrance, your supplies of food and water count as one item each, as long as your current Supply rating is 4 or lower. See the table below. When your Supply rating hits zero for food or water, this consumable no longer encumbers you. Air and power don&rsquo;t usually count toward your encumbrance, as they are generally included in your pressure suit or other gear. <br />External air tanks or batteries can count as encumbering items however.

The Patna&rsquo;s full capabilities are unknown, although she is rumored to carry nukes while moving through UPP and UA space&mdash;a clear violation of both the Strategic Arms Reduction and Washington Treaties.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MANUFACTURER: </strong>Weyland-Yutani</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CREW: </strong>12 (or MU/TH/UR 9000 plus one Hyperdyne 341-B model android)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TROOP CAPACITY: </strong>90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LENGTH: </strong>731m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">FTL RATING: </strong>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SIGNATURE: </strong>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THRUSTERS: </strong>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HULL: </strong>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ARMOR RATING: </strong>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ARMAMENTS: </strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Long Lance ASAT Missiles (8 missiles)</li>\n<li>Heavy Railgun Turret</li>\n<li>800MeV Particle Beam Weapon</li>\n<li>Orbital Mines (60 mines)</li>\n<li>Tactical Nukes (20 missiles)</li>\n<li>CIWS Laser Array</li>\n<li>Sensor Drones</li>\n<li>Sensor Decoys</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Internal Modules:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence I</li>\n<li>Air Scrubbers IV</li>\n<li>Cargo Bay III</li>\n<li>Cryo Deck IV</li>\n<li>Docking Umbilical II</li>\n<li>EEV I x 20</li>\n<li>Galley IV</li>\n<li>Hangar IV</li>\n<li>Medlab I</li>\n</ul>\n<strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Upgrades:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Boosted Displacement Drives x 6</li>\n<li>Enhanced Sensors</li>\n<li>Overpowered Thrusters</li>\n<li>Stealth Technology</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"arpgtable\" style=\"width: 65%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em style=\"color: azure;\">SMUGGLER&rsquo;S RUN <br />&ldquo;So I teamed up with that bastard Tomland and we were on the Volcus run.

God damn border patrol. <br />Colonial marshals riding a Conestoga frigate. Delivery boy panics and fires on the marshals with a mining laser. <br />Yep. <br />They don&rsquo;t like that one bit, so they cycle up the rail gun and send a spike right up his ass. It cut his tug in two and plows right into the damn energy tanker. The juice in those batteries went up real fast. The Cony got slammed with the blast and we used the diversion to get the fuck out of there. <br />But those marshals weren&rsquo;t done yet. They took off after us &mdash; and I mean right after us. Tomland was flying in a god damn straight line. The only maneuvers he made were to keep the Cony directly behind us. <br />Always. <br />I thought he was crazy until I saw they weren&rsquo;t firing on us &mdash; not even a warning shot. Tomland was ex-military and knew his shit. <br />He figured the EMP from the tanker explosion had fried the Cony&rsquo;s particle beams and ASATs, but her rails should have worked just fine. <br />Turns out the big bitch can't fire her big guns straight on &mdash; they&rsquo;re right in the line of sight of her hull. For all her bluster, she&rsquo;s got a blind spot right in front and behind her. Tommy kept us dead ahead of them until we gained enough distance to kick in the displacement drive and go FTL. <br />The marshals stayed behind to clean up the mess. <br />In the end, the cargo was blown, my contact was dead, the marshals were pissed, and the Cony was fried. We managed to get out of there though. <br />I scuttled the ship, quit the business and became a cattle rancher on Terraform 3. <br />Much happier now. <br />I&rsquo;m only here on Anchorpoint to drop off a load of beef.&rdquo;</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; color: azure;\">&mdash;OVERHEARD IN THE OKIE CLUB ON ANCHORPOINT STATION</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

If you have access to the official Maps &amp; Markers Pack for the ALIEN roleplaying game (sold separately), use a spaceship marker with the &ldquo;ping&rdquo; side up. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TRANSPONDERS:</strong> All civilian spacecraft are required to travel with their transponders switched on. The transponder transmits data about the ship&rsquo;s position, name, class, home port, and destination. If the approaching ship has an active transponder, you will immediately learn this information, and you are able to target the ship with your ship armaments (more on that below).

By powering down your engines and sensors, you can make it harder for an approaching ship to lock on to you. This can be done even before the encounters starts, if you expect trouble. Turning off your sensors reduces your Signature rating one step, while powering down your engines reduces your Signature two steps. When your sensors are down, you cannot Target Lock. When the engines are offline, you cannot perform any pilot actions at all. Powering a ship back up takes one Turn.

In the game, this is represented by what we call stealth mode. Stealth mode is played out in Turns. <br />In one Turn, you can move two zones on the map and explore them, scanning for enemies and getting a superficial description of these two zones from the GM. If you&rsquo;re a team, you can explore the map individually or as a group. <br />If you want to examine something in a zone more closely, such as accessing a data terminal, you need to stay one entire Turn (or even longer) in a single zone. <br />The GM has final say.</p>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">ENEMY MOVEMENT</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">DETECTION</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">In stealth mode, enemy movement is handled secretly by the GM. This is carried out each Turn, after your PCs have moved. NPCs must comply with the same rules of movement as PCs&mdash;human NPCs can only move two zones per Turn. Non-human characters may move faster or have other special rules. <br />To handle NPC movement, we recommend that the GM has a second copy of the conflict map, hidden from view by the GM Screen (available for purchase separately). On this map, the GM can place tokens to represent NPCs, hidden from the players&rsquo; view. <br />If your GM doesn&rsquo;t have access to a screen, she can simply track hidden NPC movement on a piece of paper. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ENEMIES:</strong> Enemies can be <strong>ACTIVE</strong> or <strong>PASSIVE</strong>, as dictated by the scenario or the GM. <strong>ACTIVE</strong> enemies are aware of you and are actively stalking you. <br /><strong>PASSIVE</strong> enemies are not aware of your presence and can be ambushed by you.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">In stealth mode, you will automatically detect <strong>PASSIVE</strong> enemies in the same zone or in line of sight (above).

You get a modification based on the distance to the enemy &mdash; see the table on the next below. <br /><br /><strong>ACTIVE</strong> enemies nearby may try to sneak up on you for a sneak attack. If so, the GM informs you that a threat is moving in on you, and then rolls <strong> MOBILITY</strong> for the enemy against your <strong> OBSERVATION</strong>. If you fail, the enemy gets a free attack against you. Read more about sneak attacks on page 56. You cannot spot <strong>ACTIVE</strong> enemies that choose to remain hidden and don&rsquo;t attack you&mdash;unless you have detected them using a motion tracker first, or the GM deems it obvious that you spot the enemy (for example, if you search the exact spot where it is hidden).</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">MOTION TRACKERS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">A useful piece of gear in stealth mode is a motion tracker, such as the M314 unit <br />(see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"e6QATvQ6bdRW8iW6\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>).

Located between the core systems and the Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast region of space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources. The Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the Colonial Navy operates there. <br />Past the Outer Rim is anyone's guess - and that thrill of the unknown is what draws pioneers here. <br />Settlers have likened the sometimes lawless Frontier to the Old West of the United States. Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds, atmospheric processors have been brought in to convert the air into something passably breathable. <br />The majority of settlers here are prospectors, entrepreneurs, farmers, and homesteaders. <br />Mining worlds refine ores and fuel, while agri and aquatic worlds harvest food and algae. Space stations such as Anchorpoint serve as a neutral staging ground for expeditions into deep space. Neighboring colonies don't always get along, and armed conflicts over stakes and claims are not uncommon - often requiring the Colonial Marines to step in and restore order. <br />The boundaries of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and sometimes colonies switch hands as border disputes redefine the map.</p>\n<h2 class=\"headng2\">TERRITORIES OF THE FRONTIER</h2>\n<p>While dominated by the United Americas, the Frontier is an area intersected by several nation-states. An uneasy alliance exists between them, yet territorial disputes are not unheard of. What follows is a listing of the major government players vying for resources there. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THREE WORLD EMPIRE:</strong> <br />Consisting of the former United Kingdom, Japan, and several developing countries, the Weyland-Yutani corporation itself is a result of the formation of the Three World Empire - created when the UK company Weyland Corp merged with the Japanese Yutani Corporation. The Three World Empire pioneered space exploration, controls many long-established inner colonies, and only maintains a limited presence on the Frontier - allowing Weyland-Yutani to take the lead there. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE UNITED AMERICAS:</strong><br />Created in the early 2100s to compete with the expanding Three World Empire, the United Americas was formed by the merger of North, Central, and South America into one nation. The United Americas is a major colonizing and starfaring power, constantly expanding the Frontier. They operate both the Colonial Marines and the Colonial Navy - the most powerful peace-keeping forces on the Frontier. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE UNION OF PROGRESSIVE PEOPLES:</strong><br />The UPP is a powerful socialist block of systems that control a vast but resource poor sector of space. Formed from a coalition of countries that includes Russia and Vietnam, the UPP is the only government that is not influenced by corporate concerns - a fact that sometimes puts them in opposition to Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind in the arms race, the UPP still maintains a formidable fighting force. A state of cold war has existed between the United Americas and the UPP for decades, but with recent events on the Frontier, all that seems poised to change. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THE INDEPENDENT CORE SYSTEM COLONIES:</strong><br />The ICSC is a loose conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each colony in the ICSC has its own government - many of which are corporate-owned. In addition to its operations within the colonies of the United Americas and the Three World Empire, Weyland-Yutani is known to maintain private interests in the ICSC - where they can conduct business as they see fit, far from the prying eyes of government control. </p>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 010:00.

Companies like Weyland-Yutani, BioNational, and Seegson are not limited by borders. In fact, they produce and control the technologies necessary for the continued existence of these star empires. The unwillingness of nation-states like the UPP to work with the private sector has left them behind in the space race.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> God at the Ass End of Space: </strong> <br />Life in the colonies is rough. After being promised a utopia, settlers instead found a frontier existence of drudgery in harsh environments. To that end, many have turned to God to get them through their daily rigors. While traditional religions are practiced throughout the colonies, sects of apocalyptic millenarian fundamentalists have arisen, as have fanatical cults and zealots driven by charismatic leaders in isolated areas. Recent years have seen the rise of fledgling organizations with questionable motives, such as the Practitioners of the Holy Immolation and the cultish Church of Immaculate Incubation.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"arpgtablesmall\" style=\"width: 40%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em style=\"color: azure;\">&ldquo;But how do you know?

Some scouts tell tales of priceless artifacts found in ancient ruins on distant moons - ruins that predate humanity by millennia. Others talk of derelict spacecraft - and a race of giants that once stalked the stars in them. Still others whisper about hostile lifeforms that overrun entire worlds - terrifying parasitic creatures that are beyond our comprehension and wholly alien. <br />Many believe Weyland-Yutani and other corporations are covertly developing new and dangerous biological weapons, ranging from plagues and drug-controlled psychopathic cyborgs to genetically-engineered monsters. If these weapons really are being developed, one has to wonder who the company is designing them for, and if a war is on the horizon. Over the past century, ships, stations, and even colonies have simply disappeared from the Frontier. Some attribute these losses to natural disasters or acts of God, others believe those involved fell prey to pirates or rival governments. Rumors of entire colonies being wiped out by a plague or nuked off the face of a planet have everyone on the Frontier living on the edge. Some even believe that man was never meant to leave Earth, and that space itself can swallow you whole. <br /><br />Shutter your storm blinds and seal the airlocks - something alien just might be out there, hiding in the dark. <br />\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>It's waiting for you.</em></h3>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 015:09.

The loss of the Sulaco's Colonial Marine unit along with these Weyland-Yutani sponsored outposts, and the implications of corporate foul play stemming from these incidents, have created an air of distrust between the company and the United Americas. Many Frontier worlds have found themselves caught in the middle of this rift and have been forced to make do without either the supplies or defenses they need to survive. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> CREW EXPENDABLE:</strong><br />The only publicly made exposition of these events deals only with the aftermath on Fiorina 161. The book is titled Space Beast and is convict Robert Morse's alleged account of an alien \"dragon\" that overran the facility and brutally slew two dozen double-Y chromo inmates and their custodial staff. The book gives credence both to talk of monsters and to rumors of Weyland-Yutani experimentation with bioweapons - indicating they were more concerned about securing the creature for further study than saving lives. According to Morse, the hunt to capture the beast had spilled over from the incident on LV-426, and anyone who got in the Company's way was expendable - be they prisoners, soldiers, employees, or even colonists. Although banned instantly, copies of Space Beast have been transmitted illegally throughout the colonies. The book has developed a strong following. Some see it as a fantasy, a welcome diversion from their normal lives. Others have embraced Morse's story and built a millenarian cult around it - believing it to be a religious text and a portent of the Armageddon to come. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"> THIS TIME IT'S WAR:</strong><br />To add fuel to the fire, conflicts between the rival sectors of space have increased exponentially in the past five years. While unconfirmed, many believe that Hadley's Hope was a test site for one of Weyland-Yutani's bioweapons and that an enemy state sent a warship to nuke it from orbit. Others believe that the Company is working with a rogue nation to assume control of the colonies on the Frontier. As more and more Colonial Marine units are recalled and re-deployed to new campaigns, Frontier colonists are becoming scared. Without the military, there is no-one to protect them from pirates, hostile lifeforms, or invasion. To compensate, many colonies have enacted their own law systems, electing Marshals to oversee daily law enforcement. Some have even hired mercenary forces to protect their interests.\n<h3 class=\"headng2\"><em>The 2180's are a dangerous time to be alive.</em></h3>\n<br />\n<p class=\"mess\"><em> SHIPS LOG, USCSS MIRANDA, 019:47.

The exterior is armored with a laser absorbent paint job. <br />In addition to chaff launchers and a small front mounted turret, the M570 mounts a rotating main weapons package on a rail system that allows it to slide back and store in the rear of the vehicle when not in use, thus lowering the APC&rsquo;s profile and heat signature. The air pressure in its large, armored wheels is controlled by the driver in order to facilitate better traction over soft terrain and allow the vehicle's chassis some additional clearance over rough ground&mdash;its low profile is perhaps the APC&rsquo;s biggest weakness.

These microfusion reactor driven gyroscopic cars can operate as wheeled ground transports or utilize internal fans to generate air cushions with a maximum flight ceiling of 3,000 meters. Cameras offer a 360-degree view and a proximity alert protects against collisions. <br />Gyrocars require a lot of upkeep and are therefore a rare sight on the Frontier and Outer Rim.

The Cheyenne are dropped from orbit into the fray from the ventral bay of any USCM frigate or carrier, swiftly descending through the atmosphere like a meteor. The current model has been specifically augmented to carry the M577 into a combat zone, deploy the APC and its marine squad, and immediately assume an air support role for the squad. The ship is mostly transport bay with cockpit, weapons systems, and engines attached&mdash;there is little in the way of other accommodations aboard. While in supersonic decent, the Cheyenne&rsquo;s weapons pods are retracted flush with its hull. These pods deploy for subsonic combat. With a proper satellite uplink, the Cheyenne is capable of being flown by remote from a portable terminal. Few pilots have the skill necessary for this maneuver, and the task is usually left to the squad&rsquo;s android XO. <br /><span class=\"arpglink\">@Actor[UD-4L Cheyenne VTOL Dropship]</span></td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol3\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Encountered: </strong>USCMC battlefields and military bases across the Frontier and Outer Rim.

Now she has us locked on course for star system HR-2429. </em></p>\n<br />\n<p>The ALIEN roleplaying game requires you to improvise as you play, but the game also provides a number of tools to help you create your story. </p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CHARACTER SHEETS</h1>\n<p>To document your character, whether it's a pre-made PC from a cinematic scenario or a character you create yourself for campaign play, you use a character sheet. There is a blank sheet at the end of this book. From the Free League website you can download character sheets for free to print.</p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">DICE</h1>\n<p>In the ALIEN universe, nowhere is safe. Sooner or later, you will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no matter how skilled you are. It's time to break out the dice. <br />There are two types of custom six-sided dice for this game, each available for purchase separately: Base Dice and Stress Dice. You roll the dice when you perform a dramatic action that might determine if your PC lives or dies. <br />Both Base Dice and Stress Dice have the <span class=\"basesymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol on the 6 side.<br /><br />Rolling the <span class=\"basesymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol usually means that an effect of some kind is triggered, for example when succeeding at using a skill. <br /><br />Stress Dice also have the symbol <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;on the 1 side. <br /><br />Rolling the <span class=\"stresssymbol\"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp;symbol triggers panic in your character. How all this works in detail, you will learn in the Skills Chapter. <br /><br />NOTE: <em>You can play this game with any normal six-sided dice, but it helps if you have them in two different colors to tell Base Dice and Stress Dice apart.</em> <!-- ROLLING DICE\n        The rules sometimes ask you to roll D6, D3, 2D6 and D66. D6 means rolling a Base Die and reading the number, ignoring any symbols. D3 means you roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up. 2D6 means you roll two D6 and add the results. Another type of roll is the D66, which means you roll two D6s -  consider the first die as the tens digit and the second die the ones digit. That gives you a result between 11 and 66. --></p>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CARDS</h1>\n<p>The boxed set contains two types of custom playing cards.

You get one XP just for being there.</li>\n<li>Did you risk or sacrifice something to further your Personal Agenda?</li>\n<li>Did you risk your life for your Buddy PC?</li>\n<li>Did you challenge or stand up to your Rival PC?</li>\n<li>Did you make a Panic Roll?</li>\n<li>Did you overcome a dangerous event, using violent or non-violent means?</li>\n<li>Did you make a significant discovery or revelation?</li>\n<li>Did you perform an extraordinary action of some kind?</li>\n<li>Did you earn any money?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can only get one XP per question. Sometimes, the answers are not clear-cut. Discuss within the group, and try to reach a consensus. <br />If you can&rsquo;t, the GM has final say. <br />Write down the XP on your character sheet. </p>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SPENDING XP</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">CHANGING BUDDY AND RIVAL</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">You can use your XP to improve your skills and talents, or to learn new ones.

Originally developed by Weyland Corporation at the end of the 21st century, the MU/TH/UR system soon became the standard for running complex automated systems and facilities. Affectionately nicknamed &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; by the crews who utilize these computers, over the decades various models have sported different levels of AI packages. While both the MU/TH/UR 1000 and 9000 series are sophisticated interactive models that over time can develop rudimentary personalities, most military, cargo, and utilitarian craft of today are equipped with the standard 5000 through 8000 series. <br />While these machines can communicate through the ship&rsquo;s intercom system, most of them can only be directly accessed through the computer core. Card and punch code entry to this secure and static free chamber is only granted to the vessel&rsquo;s commanding officer. The computer core also allows the commanding officer to issue alternate commands and overrides to \"Mother&rsquo;s\" automated routine. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">A.P.O.L.L.O.:</strong> Seegson&rsquo;s answer to MU/TH/UR, A.P.O.L.L.O. was designed to coordinate Seegson&rsquo;s Working Joe synthetics to run a starship.

Weyland Corp scientists took optical disc media and enhanced it to the next level. The result is a nano-optical long-data memory disc. Called LDs, each disc can hold up to 10 zettabytes (ZB) of data.

Utilizing sputter deposition technology, these cassettes can hold between 60, 90, or 120 terabytes (TB) of information each. While easily disrupted by a strong magnetic pulse, the benefit of magnetic tapes is that the archaic technology that runs them produces no easily detected wave signals. Most security sensor grids are set to detect more sophisticated electronic hardware.

With the right skills (<strong>COMTECH</strong> roll) and access codes, you can use a PR-PUT to patch into a colony uplink tower and remote pilot an orbiting ship. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON C-SERIES MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDER:</strong> An &ldquo;old tech&rdquo; portable audio recorder used to record or play music and audio logs. Popular models include the classic C-24 ka-boombox and the just released portable C-60 &ldquo;spacewalk-man.&rdquo; Now when you go EVA you can bring your country blues with you (<strong>MANIPULATION</strong> +1). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SAMANI E-SERIES WATCH:</strong> A dual-faced precision wristwatch, each Samani E-series device is capable of telling the time and date for two synchronized colonial locations, allowing space travelers to keep track of time back home while they are in deep space. The latest addition, the E-550, includes oxygen and pressure sensors to warn its user of a hull breach (<strong>SURVIVAL</strong> +1). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PERSONAL DATA TRANSMITTER:</strong> These &ldquo;PDTs&rdquo; transmit the recipient&rsquo;s location. Some models also monitor vital signs. Most corporate sponsored Frontier worlds equip their colonists with PDTs in order to keep track of them in hostile environments. PDTs can be surgically implanted, built into a pressure suit, or worn as an accessory. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">IFF TRANSPONDER:</strong> A personal beacon that prevents automated sentry systems from accidentally blowing friendly targets to pieces. Usually surgically implanted before a campaign, the only flaws in the system are when their signal is disrupted and when an enemy gets their hands on a transceiver for infiltration purposes. How is this accomplished if IFFs are surgically implanted? You&rsquo;d be amazed what a good sharp knife can do. <br /><br /></td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DATA TRANSMITTER CARDS:</strong> DTCs are small clear plastic data transmitter cards that plug into a variety of recording equipment, such as the built-in visual and audio recorders on a space suit helmet. They wirelessly transmit data to the terminal they are synced to. Information captured by the device can be analyzed by a MU/TH/UR or A.P.O.L.L.O. system or displayed on a HoloTab. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON P-DAT:</strong> A personal data tablet, a P-DAT can be synced with Spectrograph Mapping Devices, PDTs, and helmet cams to coordinate a team on the go. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SEEGSON SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE:</strong> The SSDD is used to troubleshoot computer and mechanical systems aboard a space station or starship. A good engineer knows how to use one of these to hack doors and computer terminals&mdash;but you didn&rsquo;t read that here (<strong>COMTECH</strong> +2). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HOLOTAB:</strong> A high end strategic and analysis platform, a HoloTab&mdash;or Holographic Display Table&mdash;takes scanned live or recorded information fed to it and generates a three dimensional hologram of the subject. A HoloTab is usually used in conjunction with pre-existing maps or in coordination with PDTs and Parameter Uplink Spectagraph hardware (<strong>COMMAND</strong> and <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> +2). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MODULAR COMPUTING DEVICE:</strong> Perfected and manufactured by Weyland Corp in the 21st Century, a MCD is a high-end full audio/visual holographic projector.

Tiny item. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">BINOCULARS:</strong> Gives a +2 modification to <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> at <strong>LONG</strong> range or more when scouting actively (not passive awareness). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">M314 MOTION TRACKER:</strong> A motion-scanning device, the M314 uses high-powered ultrasonic waves to detect movement within its sensor range (<strong>EXTREME</strong> range in open terrain, <strong>LONG</strong> range in close quarters). Originally designed for rescue teams searching for civilians trapped in cave-ins and collapsed buildings, the tracker soon found use by the military fighting guerilla forces in extrasolar environments that made infrared impractical. You need to make a Power Supply roll after every use. Its battery has a Power Supply level of 5 when fully charged. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">M316 MOTION TRACKER:</strong> The drawback to the M314 is its size and weight&mdash;you can't fire your weapon and operate the tracker at the same time. An experimental pulse rifle mounted upgrade&mdash;the M316&mdash;is currently being field tested. The good news? It is compact, lightweight and easy to glance at in a firefight. Of course, with good news always comes bad. While the M316 operates about the same as the M314, it has a much more limited range&mdash;<strong>LONG</strong> outdoors and <strong>MEDIUM</strong> indoors. Your results may vary, but that&rsquo;s what you grunts are for&mdash;cannon fodder to help the big corporations figure out how to perfect their new toys. Power Supply level 3 when fully charged. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HEAD-MOUNTED SIGHT:</strong> Syncs with smart gun or robot sentry technology to help an operator focus on and choose targets.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">NEURO VISOR:</strong> A neuro visor is a helmet with a HUD visor that allows an operator to monitor and interface with the subconscious and dreams of a subject in stasis. A skilled user (requires a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll) can also use a neurovisor to communicate with the hyper sleeping subject, and an advanced user can use one to manipulate one&rsquo;s dreams&mdash;so the next time you go into hypersleep, keep those dreams clean&mdash;your supervisor could be watching. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">W-Y PARAMETER UPLINK SPECTROGRAPH MAPPING DEVICE:</strong> Sometimes called &ldquo;Pups,&rdquo; these cost-prohibitive mapping devices have been in use for a good hundred years. Pups employ limited anti-gravity propulsion to float through, across, and over otherwise difficult to navigate terrain. As these orbs scout about, they constantly scan a 360-degree area around the device with mapping lasers. The Pups then send the spectrograph information back to a synced device, usually a starship or ground-based HoloTab or a monitoring station in a mobile command vehicle. They can also detect lifeforms, atmospheric conditions, toxins, and more. Pups were given their nickname because they emit a haunting, hound-like howling sound as they seek and scan. They can scan one zone per Round, and detect any enemies in zones they pass.

All models of the Pauling MedPod feature an airtight operating shield, comfortable limb restraints, a laser scalpel, computer controlled robotic surgical arms, liquid spray anesthetic and vital signs sensors, all mounted on an adjustable titanium base.

The vetting process isn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;in addition to competency and physical prerequisites, candidates must endure an intense psychological screening process that many potential colonists fail. <br />However, once you are approved for a colony, you are essentially set up in that position for life, assuming you don't screw up royally. <br /><br />Corporations and the colonial administration can&rsquo;t be bothered to replace a farmsteader or terraforming maintenance engineer like you for minor infractions. Also, the job has the added bonus of your descendants inheriting your position. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no glory or glamour to be had as a colonist&mdash;the colonies on the Frontier are experiencing an economic depression while the companies in the Core Systems grow fat off of the hard labor of others. Supplies are limited and more often than not, colonists are told to ration and improvise.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">JUST IN TOWN FOR SUPPLIES</h1>\n<p>While most Frontier jobs are colony-based, they all interact in one way or another. <br />Prospectors and wildcatters survey the terrain, staking claims to mineral deposits and drilling exploratory wells in unexplored regions. <br />Miners often serve a one-year contract at a particular colony site before being rotated out. <br />Farmers grow produce, maintenance engineers keep the atmospheric processors running, general managers oversee it all, and the marshals keep everyone in line. <br />Space truckers deliver supplies to the colony and bring that world&rsquo;s exports back to the Inner Core Systems. Many corporate cargo haulers are former Colonial Navy veterans who are down on their luck. <br />The Colonial Marines and Navy protect these worlds, also rotating in and out along the Frontier. <br />Finally, corporations will send security and assessment teams to ensure their resources are being well cared for. <br />Taken all together, it represents the well-oiled machine of commerce &mdash; and everyone in it is just a cog, a replaceable cog. <br /><br />Then there is the fringe element. <br />Mercenaries, vagabonds and privateers move from colony to colony, looking to eke out a living on the fringe of normal society. Some are criminals on the run, others are just disenchanted with colonial and corporate bureaucracy. <br />Many are dangerous.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SPACESHIPS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SPACE STATIONS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Between scouting missions and cargo runs, people on the Frontier spend a lot of time in massive metal cans hurtling through space.

Station design is as varied as that of starcraft &mdash; some consist of several towers with a connecting latticework of travel tubes while others are built out into the spires of massive decommissioned refinery modules. <br />Still more utilize more traditional forms such as a wheel or sphere. While most are built out of titanium composite and other high-end alloys, some, such as the religious colony Arceon, are also composed of exotic materials. Most space stations are like overpopulated cities in space&mdash;quarters are cramped for all but the elite, those in the working class live and work right on top of one another, and crime runs rampant. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CLAUSTROPHOBIA IN THE VOID:</strong> People need room to breathe. Space itself might be vast, but there just isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of it available in the stations floating amongst the stars.

These large monitors project breathtaking views of natural vistas such as wooded glades, tropical beaches, or majestic mountain ranges.

Located in unclaimed space a few scant parsecs from UAAC base Liberty Echo, Anchorpoint is a convenient place to pick up supplies, get some grub, refuel, make repairs in drydock, and pick up migrant crew and workers for your next job. Location is everything, and Anchorpoint is positioned perfectly to service the southern Outer Rim and the Far Reach, providing an alternate route from the Solomons to civilized space. <br />Anchorpoint is considered neutral territory and is governed by the ICSC&mdash;vessels from any and all governments and corporations are welcome here. The ICC and Colonial Administration often send representatives to negotiate intercolonial disputes at Anchorpoint. The UA operates a Colonial Marshal Bureau aboard, and a small contingent of Colonial Marines is stationed in the garrison office in tower four. <br />The station has a very small permanent population, but can easily house over 3,000 transient workers and colonists.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\" style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">Anchorpoint is composed of four refinery modules situated around a central core hub. Three of the modules have been converted to habitable space similar to the Seegson company&rsquo;s former Sevastopol station, while the fourth is a functioning refinery for processing ores and gases bound for the Frontier colonies. With concourses laid out similar to a terrestrial spaceport, the station is known for its dive bars, open mall areas, service androids, and inexpensive entertainment. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">WHAT&rsquo;S THE STORY, MOTHER?</strong> While only three years old, the newest incarnation of Anchorpoint is the most successful space station project outside of Sol system. The original Anchorpoint was a colonial refueling hub/science station situated in the Neroid Sector, close to UPP space.

Originally an old class V habitation sphere, the mile-wide Arceon was repurposed as a monastery for a reclusive technophobic monastic order. All metallic areas within and without were covered with wood, and all structures within the sphere&mdash;an abbey, libraries, communal baths, reservoirs, and even a massive glassworks&mdash;are wooden and archaic in nature. <br />Inside, there are open spaces with ceilings as high as 100 meters tall, and the structure itself is layered like an ant&rsquo;s nest. Arceon sports grass fields where crops and livestock are grown and maintained. It is large enough and rotates fast enough to maintain its own thin atmosphere which is continuously processed and replenished by technology located at the core of the wooden world. The upper hemisphere of the station is dominated by a massive lake, replete with marine life.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\" style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">WHAT&rsquo;S THE STORY, MOTHER?</strong> Arceon was founded by a monastic &ldquo;back to nature&rdquo; movement in the 2100s. While initially dismissed as a cult, the order proved to be dangerous when they used the enhanced computer virus called New Plague to wipe out an inordinate amount of data on Earth, crippling credit unions and trans-stellar corporations alike. The group even detonated low yield nukes in key metropolitan sectors, utilizing the electromagnetic pulse to force people to get by without technology. As more and more followers flocked to the order, action was taken. Rounded up and arrested by a joint 3WE and UA task force, the order&rsquo;s final sentencing was suspended when Weyland Corp bought off the judges. The monks were ultimately released into the conscripted custody of Weyland-Yutani, who relocated them to Arceon in exchange for the employment of their leader, Saint Tomas&mdash;the computer genius behind the New Plague. On Arceon, the group is led by an Abbot. Also, an older model android called Brother Anthony resides with them to keep them from rising again. W-Y ships stopped running supplies to Arceon after Tomas died decades ago, and the monks</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">DEEP SPACE COLONIES</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">The concept of the colonies that was sold to the general public was one of an off-world paradise. While some planets did eventually become just that, they are the product of the blood, sweat, and tears of generations of colonists. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TERRAFORMING:</strong> Terraforming began at home in the 2010s, repairing the earth&rsquo;s ecosystem from the ravages of war and pollution. The next step was the Moon, where localized areas were pressurized and transformed. Mars soon followed. While global warming was arrested as soon as the processors took effect, it still took decades to make the Earth whole again. In a move to acclimate people to the idea of life amongst the stars, Sir Peter Weyland offered incentives to move off-world and colonize the solar system while the Earth healed. <br />The strategy was successful, and soon colonies were popping up as far away as Saturn. Within a decade of the inception of the FTL drive, Weyland Industries had set up an Atmospheric Processing Plant (APP) on an extrasolar world, and it wasn't long before people were eager to colonize there as well. In the 21st Century, terraforming helped humanity to settle the stars. The costly process was exacting and only performed on planets that had near earth conditions, thus prompting the planet to help sustain itself once the expensive terraforming was complete. <br /><br />When the Yutani Corporation merged with Weyland Corp at the start of the 22nd Century, terraforming was deemed unprofitable and put to rest. Instead, W-Y astronomers searched the heavens for planets that could support human life on their own. Colony missions like the Affiance and the ill-fated Covenant were sent off to start life on newly discovered Earth-like planets. Without the enormous economic strain that the Weyland Corporation had endured in their efforts to transform entire worlds, Weyland-Yutani prospered. The new model wouldn&rsquo;t last. As more and more people relocated to the existing off-world colonies, populations on these worlds soared and resources again diminished. Soon, the supply of habitable worlds was outweighed by demand.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">BUILDING BETTER WORLDS:</strong> Over the next fifty years, more and more resources were found on barren worlds along the shifting Frontier, prompting Weyland-Yutani to resurrect terraforming and create a new fast and dirty form of atmospheric processing. Recycling a hundred-year-old ad campaign, Weyland-Yutani again boasted they were &ldquo;building better worlds.&rdquo; <br />The claim was and still is debatable. <br />Colloquially called a &ldquo;Shake and Bake&rdquo; colony, an Atmospheric Processor (AP) is introduced to a planet or moon to scrub its atmosphere without the safety standards of the original Weyland APPs. Essentially giant fusion reactors, these completely automated W-Y APs still require constant monitoring and maintenance, and colonies are often set up on worlds for the sole purpose of servicing them. Weyland-Yutani has deployed APPs across the Frontier, creating colonies on any world that might have exploitable resources. <br /><br />Terraforming can be a misnomer. <br />It can take decades to transform a planet&rsquo;s ecology, and it doesn't always hold. Most of the worlds undergoing the process will never become earth-like. They are barren, desolate, and alien places that the processors can only alter enough for man to survive on without a pressure suit. <br />Some of these worlds even require APs to constantly run in order to maintain a suitable atmosphere, making the processor a prime target for enemy powers and insurgents. Some planets or planetoids that are rich in mineral resources are simply unable to even begin to support the terraforming process. In those cases, pressurized facilities are built on the surface to house laborers and their families. Because of this, colonies can be built in nearly any environment. Ocean, jungle, desert, arctic, and barren worlds are all common.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">LIVING QUARTERS</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">In space, no one can hear you snore&hellip; in hypersleep, at least. When not in stasis, however, you need a place to bed down and call your own. Here are your options. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ON ROTATION:</strong> As a mining and construction worker, you are often on rotation, and therefore do not rate for full quarters. Instead, you bunk in communal sleeping areas called cages. These facilities have stacked levels of meshed enclosures just long enough for a bedroll and tall enough to sit up in. A small locker and personal effects area is built into the headboard, and privacy is accomplished through the use of blinds. Just as on starships, showers and toilet facilities are shared. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LONG HAULS:</strong> On military and commercial starship runs, most of your sleep time is done in stasis pods. For personal time while traveling in system, many freighters have a common area with recessed bunks built into the walls. Like the cages, these accommodations can be closed off with blinds or curtains, and can be decorated according to your discerning tastes (or lack thereof). Showers, the bathroom, galley and mess area are all communal on these service ships, so the coffin-like bunks offer the only private place for most military and long-haul crews.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CRAMPED QUARTERS:</strong> On some space stations, populations are high, and space is optimized. Don&rsquo;t expect to get too comfortable in such places. The lower levels of stations like Gateway have tight hallways and cramped studio apartments with kitchenettes and bathroom facilities all in the same small area. These apartments can be so small that it is uncomfortable for two people to navigate one at the same time. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">GALAXY STANDARD:</strong> Crew quarters on colony and scientific exploration ships are often more roomy, consisting of a standardized studio area with a small private bathroom. If you&rsquo;re skilled enough, you might even rate your own viewport. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LUXURY ACCOMMODATIONS:</strong> Don&rsquo;t expect to spend much time in any of these. Lavish to the extreme, these penthouse apartments on starships and stations are sometimes located on a separate module with its own support system and supplies.

Transmissions are not instantaneous, sometimes taking weeks or months to reach the recipient. Fortunately, Weyland-Yutani has built a sophisticated communication satellite grid surrounding most inhabited sectors of space. Known as the Network, all signals are routed through it, sometimes bouncing off of thousands of comm arrays before reaching their destination. <br /><br />Intersystem communications are much more immediate, ranging from real time to a short lag, depending on how far out one is from the recipient. <br /><br />Massive antenna arrays and satellite dishes dominate spacecraft, stations, and ground facilities, and a viable hard-wired uplink to them is necessary for transmissions of any kind. Both interstellar and intersystem long distance personal calls can be extremely expensive, and if there are few comm facilities available or there is high comm traffic across the Network, you can find yourself waiting days before you receive authorized time for that critical call. <br />As it can take extended periods for a reply, most colonial general managers, marshals, and military commanders are forced to make decisions based on their personal interpretation of policy without the approval of the company or Colonial Administration. As life out on the ass-end of space can take its toll on the psyche, this sometimes leads to bizarre extrapolations of laws and procedures.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LOST IN TRANSMISSION:</strong> No one can hear you scream, but you can hear a star sing. Space is also noisy. Pulsars, black holes, and other stellar phenomena all produce transmissions on a wide variety of frequencies. Communication buffers weed out these errant signals, but because of this, legitimate transmissions with weak signals can sometimes be lost in the mix. <br />Intersystem call cards are tied directly to a specific recipient. These cards provide you with a direct line to your loved ones &mdash; Network and distance permitting. Often used as business cards by corporate reps, these transparent prism plastic cards will automatically connect to the rep&rsquo;s receiver when inserted into a comm terminal.

On the Frontier, that boredom is remedied through music, drink, and recreational drugs (for more on these, see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"e6QATvQ6bdRW8iW6\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>) prescribed by company physicians. <br />On the music scene, classic rock and country have seen a resurgence along the outer colonies. Recordings are downloaded from the Network and copied onto disposable cassettes. If one pays heavy subscription fees, broadcast entertainment can also be accessed. <br />Most of the recreational content on the Network exists to promote a company's products and consists of reality programming, shopping networks, and glorified corporate propaganda. Just as it is with computer equipment, entertainment technology ranges from high-end holographic representations to the standard monotone, two-dimensional monitors. Entertainment terminals on colonies, stations, and even some ships provide access to a variety of electronic games. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">RECREATIONAL DRUGS AND DRINK:</strong> <br />Time to get your buzz on. <br />Alcohol remains the old go to, with whiskey and vodka dominating the market. The beer of choice on the frontier is Weyland-Yutani&rsquo;s original and genuine &ldquo;extra strong&rdquo; Aspen beer. It&rsquo;s watered down and tastes like piss but it gets the job done&mdash;and it&rsquo;s better than that Souta Dry crap. <br />Other substances and supplements are covered under Pharmaceuticals in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"e6QATvQ6bdRW8iW6\">OTHER EQUIPMENT</a>.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>PERCHANCE TO DREAM</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">As noted earlier, a lot of time in space is spent in cryosleep&mdash;a state in which your bodily functions and aging are slowed to the point of near suspension. Your mind, however, can dream. In fact, an entire industry is devoted to manufactured and creative dreams. <br /><br />Talented dreamers can manipulate their own dreams, which can be recorded by expensive monitoring equipment and played back for the entertainment of less imaginative sleepers. Skilled dreamers weave and craft stories and adventures in their subconscious minds. Those sponsored by corporations&mdash;which is most of them&mdash;insert subliminal messages into your mind as you sleep. <br /><br />With some skill, it&rsquo;s possible to use dream monitoring equipment combined with a Neuro Visor helmet to consciously enter the dream of someone in stasis and communicate with them.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">RELIGION</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Devotion to God is a force to be reckoned with. Traditional religions still exist in the 22nd Century, and are represented on the Frontier in one form or another. Due to the economic depression and rigors of life in space, extreme offshoots and sects are more commonplace. <br />Apocalypse cults, fundamentalist missionaries, and spiritual gurus travel the Frontier, recruiting colonists and strengthening their flock. <br />In fact, the one egg that corporations seem to have been unable to crack is religion. Even small cults can be fanatical enough to evoke change, and companies want employees with that kind of fervor working for them. Corporate execs have even attempted &mdash; so far without success&mdash;to create a cult or two of their own. Some have come to the conclusion that beliefs can&rsquo;t be manufactured, only sponsored. To that end, corporate reps have begun approaching existing religious groups in the hopes of aligning goals in the name of the almighty profit margin. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MILLENARIAN DOOMSAYERS:</strong> Fundamentalist groups that believe the end times are near, millenarian doomsayers await their final judgment and the coming of God. Vowing celibacy, members of these apocalyptic brotherhoods seek to atone for their past sins through hard labor and devout penance. Unsurprisingly, the largest fanatical followings are on prison colonies, where the population has nothing to do but await apocalyptic redemption. As such, doomsayer groups often attract reformed murderers and rapists. Punishment for those who stray is often severe, ranging from isolation to starvation, severe beatings, and even mutilation. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MONASTIC ORDER OF ARCEON:</strong> An anti-technology movement that started on Earth, the Order of Arceon grew exponentially when a computer virus wiped out a huge portion of the world&rsquo;s data. After it was exposed that a member of the Order was responsible for the virus, the movement was deemed a global threat by the Three World Empire. Those directly responsible were arrested and Weyland-Yutani was contracted to contain and move the rest of the Order&rsquo;s members to an off-world location. The movement was squashed and the Order was transplanted to the artificial satellite world of Arceon (more on Arceon in the space station section). There they live a monastic and mostly technologically free existence on a space station that ironically could not exist without technology.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">PRACTITIONERS OF THE HOLY IMMOLATION:</strong> A quasi-religious pacifist group in direct opposition to the corporate domination of the colonies, the Practitioners of the Holy Immolation first emerged during the Tientsin Campaign. Since then, these fanatics have become known for staging protests where one or more of their members will immolate themselves in the name of a free Frontier. Mostly a threat to themselves, they sometimes endanger others when their fires grow out of control in sensitive areas, such as in a biodome or on a space station. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CHURCH OF IMMACULATE INCUBATION:</strong> Not much is known about this fledgling group. Some authorities suspect they might be a splinter faction of the infamous Earthsavers cult. <br />A century-old group originally formed by dreamer and self-proclaimed prophet Duncan Fields, the Earthsavers believed that humanity's sojourn to the stars would herald the apocalypse. Like that long dead organization, the Church of Immaculate Incubation places heavy emphasis on the apocalyptic dreams of its fanatical seers. They believe the end times are fast approaching, but their spin is that the only survivors will be those who have sought out and achieved transformation to a higher form. This metamorphosis is attained by accepting what they call the Seed of God into their hearts. With few members and nothing to back up their claims, the Church of Immaculate Incubation is essentially harmless. Believing the alien creature in Robert Morse&rsquo;s banned book to have messianic significance to the imminent apocalypse, the Church readily distributes illegal copies of Space Beast throughout the colonies. As they seek to share the dreams of their prophets with their flock, they also actively recruit professional dreamers to their cause. Their enigmatic leader is rumored to be a wealthy man who has forsaken the good life and poured his resources into the Church.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">LAW ENFORCEMENT</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Insurrections, revolutions, coups, crime, and atrocities are all too common in the colonies. As such, there are various levels of law enforcement on the Frontier. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE OFFICE OF THE COLONIAL MARSHALS:</strong> <br />The OCM is your local police force. For a colony of 500&ndash;3,000 colonists, there will usually be a single marshal, a sergeant, and a group of around a dozen officers. Colonies of less than 300 individuals usually have only one marshal and one deputy. At higher population levels, the marshal's office grows with the importance of the colony itself. They are supposed to enforce colonial law over corporate policy, but many have been paid to look the other way when it comes to company business. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">UNITED STATES COLONIAL MARINE CORPS:</strong> <br />Some colonies will have a Colonial Marine Corps office and/or a contingent attached to them. Those that don&rsquo;t are still under the jurisdiction and protection of the USCMC and the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet, and are usually within days to weeks of receiving support in case of an emergency. Operated by the United Americas Allied Command, they keep order on the borders of known space. While other nations have their own soldiers and support ships, none save that of the UPP come close to matching the strength of the Colonial Marines.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CORPORATE SECURITY FORCE:</strong> In addition to colonial protection, a corporation sponsoring a colony might have its own security force attached to it. This security team would operate outside the jurisdiction of the OCM and the USCMC, and exist to ensure corporate policy is enforced. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">INTERSTELLAR COMMERCE COMMISSION:</strong> <br />A central organization that conducts and monitors interstellar trade, the ICC has its own inspectors and agents that enforce regulations and quarantine procedures throughout the colonies. While owned and operated by Weyland-Yutani, they are allegedly an autonomous organization that regulates all trade equally. <br />Allegedly.&ensp; <br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>THE LOCK UP</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">When you&rsquo;ve done the crime, you&rsquo;ve got to do the time. <br />Frontier jail facilities range from simple barred rooms to sensory deprivation chambers. On space stations, maximum security isolation cells are kept in a state of vacuum and null gravity. Prisoners detained within are suspended in pressure suits. <br /><br />Prisons are another story. <br />Most correctional facilities are owned by private companies like Weyland-Yutani and the Jĭngt&igrave; L&oacute;ng Corporation. <br />Why? They provide a plentiful source of cheap manual labor. These prisons are built in extreme environments that are high in resources but too dangerous for civilian employees to exploit in a cost-effective manner. Prisoners work for benefits such as healthcare, interstellar comm calls, and cigarettes. Some of these corporate run maximum security facilities may hold up to two million convicts. In order to keep track of inmates, all are tattooed with a barcode at the base of their neck.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

First, roll your <strong>MOBILITY</strong> versus your target&rsquo;s <strong>OBSERVATION</strong>. You get a modification depending on how close you want to go. See the table to the right. <br />If you want to attack in close combat, you usually have to move to within <strong>Engaged</strong> range of your enemy. If you fail, your opponent spots you at your starting distance&mdash;draw initiative.<br />If you succeed, you get a free action (slow or fast, but not both) before you draw the initiative. Your target cannot block a sneak attack. Sneak attacks are always done individually, by one attacker against one target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">AMBUSH:</strong> A special kind of sneak attack is an ambush. <br />You lie in wait for your enemy and attack when they come close. When you ambush someone, you roll <strong>MOBILITY</strong> as described above, but with a modification of +2, since it is the target and not the attacker that is moving. Ambushes can be carried out by a group and against a group of targets. <br />This follows the usual rules for stealth&mdash;the character with the lowest <strong>MOBILITY</strong> skill level rolls for the attackers, while the target with highest <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> skill level rolls for the targets.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption style=\"color: deepskyblue;\"><strong> SNEAK ATTACKS &amp; AMBUSHES </strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"ehead\">\n<td class=\"scol1\">RANGE</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">MODIFICATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Engaged</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">&ndash;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Short</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">&ndash;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Medium</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Long</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\">Extreme</td>\n<td class=\"ecol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"ecol2\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

{"_id":"vx9obCbNZfCC1hW8","name":"CAREERS ON THE FRONTIER","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\"><br />\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;color:greenyellow\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">FRONTIER COLONISTS</span></h2>\n<p>To most, becoming a colonist means you accept a hard life with little reward other than the satisfaction of a job well done. A colonist's hands are always dirty and their feet are always tired. Living on the edge of civilization can have its benefits, however. Depending on your profession, the chance to strike it big could be right around the corner. Frontier Colonists are scouts and homesteaders, farmers and scientists, miners and doctors. Colonial Marshals keep the peace and Frontier journalists keep the colonies in the know. Colonists are the lifeblood of humanity.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;color:greenyellow\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">SPACE TRUCKERS</span></h2>\n<p>While not as lucrative a field as it was some fifty years ago, hauling refineries and cargo between Earth and the colonies is still big business. The advent of newer and faster FTL drives has significantly shortened the travel time between worlds, ensuring that starship crews don't have to spend nearly as much time in stasis. Most companies compensate their crews not only for their work but for time lost in hypersleep as well. While most space truckers work for one corporation or another, there are also independent trader captains, smugglers, salvage crews, and privateers. Space is big and, legally or off the books, people and things always need to get from one side of it to the other.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;color:greenyellow\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">COLONIAL MARINES</span></h2>\n<p>The United States Colonial Marine Corps represents the finest fighting force ever assembled. Technologically advanced and sporting all the latest in military hardware - a large amount of which is designed by Weyland-Yutani - the Colonial Marines are able to operate independently in nearly any environment. Combat teams are cross-trained and can be deployed at a moment's notice to nearly any world without extensive briefing. Military occupations include vehicle operators and pilots, combat technicians, heavy weapons specialists, medics, engineers, and career officers. Naval occupations are found in the USCM support service of warship and starfighter teams of the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet, and there are special military R&amp;D programs across the spectrum that require volunteers. On the Frontier, there is always something that needs defending and some planet that needs pacifying.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;color:greenyellow\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">COMPANY REPS</span></h2>\n<p>Corporations have more power than governments on the Frontier. They own worlds, set up shop, and bring in the colonists, creating homes and jobs. From CEOs to field agents, each company sends out its own representatives to oversee their business ventures. Companies like Weyland-Yutani have been known to employ their own commando security teams, doctors, and scientists as well. Also, there is big business in knowing your competitors' next move - so many corporations have their own counterintelligence personnel embedded in rival companies and governments. Being a company rep is all about the art of the deal and making sure the little people around you do their jobs so that you can make your next promotion.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CnrW4G4ZnTHuAkok":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.qbhzvzAPHNIIRyO5"}}}
