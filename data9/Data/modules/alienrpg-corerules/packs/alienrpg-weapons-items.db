The weapon has a plasma charge build-up delay up firing-so take care in lining up your target and make sure you hold steady. If you pull the trigger and check to see why it hasn't gone off yet, you just may accidently redefine the term \"friendly fire.\" This weapon must be aimed carefully (fast action) before it's fired. The weapon consumes a lot of electricity, and you need to make a Power Supply roll after ever shot. Its battery has a Power Supply level of 5 when fully charged.","label":"Text"}},"notes":{"notes":null}},"effects":[],"folder":"j8bpPrnRYXCuPEzy","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"YEoPmwinvi5w1FW6":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-weapons.jbOuG8YPikgF6Ijv"}}}
