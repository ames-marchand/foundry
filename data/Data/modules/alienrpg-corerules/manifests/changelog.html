<h1> <b>Alien RPG Core Rules Module Patch V2.0.4</b></h1>
<b><br>
    This is a modified import script for Foundry VTT Version 8.6. <br>
    This script will not work under Foundry VTT Version 7.10.

</b>
<br><br>
This script will correct the following issues:
<ul>
    <li>V9 compatibility fixes</li>
    <li>Corrected bad weapons links in the WEAPONS AND ARMOR journal entry. </li>
</ul>
<br>
If maps are active or contain tokens,lights or notes they will not be replaced as I don't want to overwrite any work you have done. <br>
You will need to import these manually when convenient.
