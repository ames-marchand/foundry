At the turn of the century, the Three World Empire and the many nations that would become the UPP claimed the star systems nearest to Earth. The American nations instead looked beyond the Outer Veil to conquer new rich and fertile territories. Many of the worlds American explorers discovered on the Outer Rim were capable of supporting life without the use of Atmospheric Processors, making colonization swift and comparatively inexpensive. The American colonies joined together and the United Americas were formed. Fearing American expansion, the fledgling UPP poured its resources into exploring and claiming a large section of the Outer Rim as well&mdash;in the process over-extending themselves and crippling their economy. While the 3WE has made its own limited push into the Outer Rim, it relies solely on Weyland-Yutani to handle such expansion efforts. While civilized to some degree, the Outer Rim Territories of today are both bountiful and full of conflict. Home to many military installations, the Outer Rim is where modern man fights his wars and faces the unknown.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">BORODINO SECTOR</h1>\n<p>Nestled in a pocket between the encroaching United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples, part of the Borodino Sector is openly disputed Frontier on the Outer Rim.

It is the site of some of the Colonial Marines&rsquo; most famous battles, including the Tientsin Campaign and the Arcturan Conflicts.

As the prison allows visitors, processing centers had to be built to accommodate them. Eventually, several visiting families decided to settle there, transforming the processing center into its own corporate run colony. Settlements developed in radiating lines from the massive prison facility and collectively became known as &ldquo;the Sprawl.&rdquo; <br />Taking advantage of its natural resources, the Seegson Corporation built several factories in the Sprawl to mass-produce gyrocars. As Weyland Corp developed better technologies, the Seegson models became less popular. The factories closed, the colony became destitute and the future prospects for those living there grew increasingly bleak. Taking advantage of the situation, the Colonial Marine Corps opened their largest recruitment center in the Outer Rim on DP-27. The USCMC offers colonists the chance to see the galaxy, making soldiers the planet&rsquo;s major export.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Outer Rim, American Arm, Borodino Sector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">United Americas, Seegson</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial moon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, overcast, freezing rain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">5&deg;C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Urban sprawl on flatlands with large lakes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">One, the Sprawl</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">60,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Soldiers, rare earth metals</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">GLIESE 326-3827 SYSTEM</h1>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><span class=\"Gliese\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Gliese 326-3827b (Bracken&rsquo;s World):</strong> An aqua-culture colony world, Bracken&rsquo;s World is covered with shallow seas and a small population of kelp farmers and their support facilities.

Caught in the crossfire, many colonists took up arms to defend themselves from both opposing forces, splitting the main island of Tientsin into several warring factions. The conflict itself was never truly resolved, with the UA and the UPP eventually pulling their forces out and allowing the colonists to fend for themselves. Without support from either side, the colony dissolved into chaos. Nuclear strikes decimated the planet&rsquo;s resource-rich archipelagos, making mining operations difficult. In recent years, Weyland-Yutani offered humanitarian aid to the Tientsin Colony in the form of older model atmospheric processors, but their offer was rejected by the current government.

Major military shipyards, service bases, and staging areas, these UAAC Outer Rim installations are off limits to any unauthorized visitors.

These systems are fortified with deep space sensor arrays and patrolled by system defense frigates. <br /><br />Located in the American Arm of the Outer Rim and close to the Borodino Frontier, the Crestus Garrison Systems are spread out across the star cluster and labeled Prime, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Forces from the Outer Rim Defense Fleet, Canadian Colonial Armed Forces, the Latin American Colonial Navy, and the United States AeroSpace Force and Colonial Marine Corps are stationed here at the ready. These systems also house top secret military and science facilities. <br /><br />While the Crestus Garrisons support the combined UAAC forces, other institutions devoted to a single military force exist as well.

The question is not if but rather when the PCs will encounter something horrific and fight desperately to escape, or give their lives so that others might do so. Fear and horror is in the very DNA of ALIEN. Your primary tools for invoking terror around the gaming table are stress and panic (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"jxvyrFLvPCAwMRCq\">STRESS &amp; PANIC</a>). Stress can be introduced by you as a GM when the PCs encounter certain horrific situations or fearsome beings, but it will mainly be incurred by the PCs in response to their own actions. This makes your job easier. You just need to introduce a terror of some kind and then let the PCs interact with it while their Stress Levels ratchet up and their Personal Agendas collide. In the end, the fight to survive will be as much against their own human nature as it will beagainst the horrific creature or situation they face. Here are three tools to use for creating horror: <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN:</strong> Not knowing what you are facing is scary. Use this to your advantage and let the enemies hide in the shadows for as long as possible. Let the players&rsquo; imaginations do the work for you. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LOSS OF CONTROL:</strong> Make the PCs feel powerless by taking away their resources. Turn off the lights. Cut the power. Make machinery malfunction. When they lose control over things, fear takes over. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HORRIBLE CHOICES:</strong> Put them in situations where they have to make difficult, life-or-death choices. Will they sacrifice one to save the many? Will they risk everything for a buddy? Make them decide.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">THE THREE STAGES OF FEAR</h1>\n<p>Creating horror in a roleplaying game is not always easy. Overdo it, and the players aren't scared anymore&mdash;downplay it, and the game drags on. The key to Game Mothering horror is to manage pacing properly and keep the major threat hidden as long as possible. To do this effectively, you need to carefully manage the stages of fear in the game: dread, terror, and horror. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DREAD:</strong> The sense that something bad is about to happen, but no-one is really sure what or why. Dread is the first stage of fear in the ALIEN roleplaying game and should be employed as often as possible. The key to using dread is planting seeds and watching events unfold. The players know something terrible is about to take place, but without knowing what it is, they can't do anything about it. This dread may evolve to the next stage, but sometimes it won't&mdash;and that's fine. <br />Examples of dread:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A control panel indicates that the airlock was just cycled manually whilst all of the crew are accounted for on the bridge.</li>\n<li>Someone finds blood on the walkway. The ship&rsquo;s cat is missing.</li>\n<li>A strange and leathery egg is found in a crashed derelict ship. It&rsquo;s like something is alive in there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">TERROR:</strong> You feel terror when you know something bad will happen any moment now. It is no longer a question of if but rather when it will take place. From a roleplaying perspective, the feeling of terror is the most effective feeling of fear as the PCs are at their most helpless state. Therefore, terror often involves the scariest moments in a gaming session. Use it selectively for maximum effect. <br />Examples of terror:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A squad of marines investigating an old mine steps into something slimy. One of the marines hears a hissing sound. She realizes that something is directly above her.</li>\n<li>A colonial marshal following a killer in the deep bowels of a space station realizes that she is the prey.</li>\n<li>A pilot on a stranded shuttle barricaded in the cockpit hears pounding on the access hatch. Something wants in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HORROR:</strong> The ultimate form of fear is horror. Horror is the moment when the danger reveals itself. It is the moment of climax. The payoff that the earlier stages of fear have hinted at. But because of this, it is also less scary than terror. When horror hits, the game mechanics take over. You draw initiative and fight it or try to escape. Horror is vital to the game, but it should be used rarely and is often best utilized late in a game session rather than early. <br />Examples of horror:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A corporate agent turns around and stands face to face with an alien baring its teeth.</li>\n<li>The egg opens and a crab-like creature lunges at the closest crew member, attaching itself to her face amidst the screams of her friends.</li>\n<li>Black, lightning-quick creatures crawl through the walls and roof towards the marine squad.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">RELIEVING STRESS</h1>\n<p>An important part of the game is managing the <strong>STRESS LEVELS</strong> of the PCs. The players have several ways to do this, such as interacting with a signature item, finding a safe place to hide, or helping each other to calm down (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"jxvyrFLvPCAwMRCq\">STRESS &amp; PANIC</a>). As the GM, let them catch their collective breath and regroup from time to time. Calmer periods are vital to keeping an atmosphere of horror throughout a game session. This also opens up new opportunities for you to ramp up the pressure. Once they feel safe and lower their guard, strike at them again. <br /><br />After all, it&rsquo;s not over until it&rsquo;s over.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SPLITTING THE TEAM</h1>\n<p>Sometimes the players will want to split up into smaller groups. Let them. When doing this, it is important that you cut back and forth between the groups so that one group does not have to wait too long for the other. Let them all stay at the table even if they are not in the same location. Trust the players to separate what they know and what their PCs know. Use the fact that they have split up to create interesting and scary situations. Also, consider what means of communication the PCs have access to. Do they have personal communicators? If not, are there communication terminals around?</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>AGENDAS, SECRETS &amp; PVP</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">Every PC&rsquo;s Personal Agenda is secret and only known to the player and the GM. Sometimes a player may want to secretly communicate something to you. We recommend that you let them, but keep it simple. Stay in the room and ask them to write something on a note. Some groups are comfortable with talking about secrets openly, separating their knowledge from that of their PCs. Find a way that makes sense to your group. Don&rsquo;t overcomplicate things. And remember &mdash; if a PC starts to act in direct opposition to the rest of the group, it&rsquo;s time to call PvP. Play the current scene to an end, and then turn the PC into an NPC.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

The United States Oil Wars have taken their toll on North America. The recent Australian Rebellion against the 3WE was ended swiftly with the nuclear strike on the Outback&rsquo;s capital, Canberra. The cost of living on Earth is extravagant, and those who aren't rich are confined to metropolitan ghettoes.

Any shipboard firefight is likely to end with someone blown out into space. Your superiors don&rsquo;t give a damn about whatever shitstorm they drop you into&mdash;they just sit back and decide who lives and dies from afar. All that plus you and your buddies are always the ones tasked with cleaning up some politician or CEO&rsquo;s mess, usually by way of bughunt, bullets, and blood. Peace through superior firepower is your way of life. <br />Thing is, you are good at it. In fact, sometimes you actually enjoy it. <br /><br />A military life in the colonies can be tough and challenging, particularly when it comes to the missions. There is no employer table for the Colonial Marines, Navy, or Army&mdash;all of their orders come from the Command HQ. <br />The missions are typically combat-orientated with military objectives, but the GM could easily substitute tables from the other campaign frameworks for inspiration if desired. Most mission objectives will be off-world installations, war zones, combat stations or fortifications. <br />The key to playing a Colonial Marine game is to have the PCs be the squad leaders, those making all of the decisions. <br />This works with almost any military group from marines to fighter pilots.

In game terms this means that the GM prepares a mission and gives the players a briefing on the objectives. If you want a more open approach we recommend that you play as a mercenary company instead.

Although impoverished and overcrowded, in the UPP the workers control the means of production. A state of cold war exists between the UPP and their long-time rivals, the UA&mdash;and standoffs between the Union of Progressive Peoples&rsquo; Space Operating Forces and the United States Colonial Marine Corps become more and more frequent every year.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> In the early 22nd Century, the UPP was formed by China and Russia in direct response to a perceived combined threat of the Three World Empire and the United Americas. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Locked in an ever-escalating arms race with these capitalist conglomerates, the UPP has always managed to stay only one step behind them despite the fact that they will not deal with Weyland-Yutani or any other corporations. Additional member states include Vietnam, Germany, Spain, and several other Asian and Eastern European countries. At the time of its inception, many androids were already in use within the member states of the UPP. They were not, however, granted citizenship status of any kind. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Now, over sixty years later, they are still just considered machines and the property of the state.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The UPP is a socialist government with a president as the head of state and a premier who presides over the state council. The UPP Frontier is overseen by a Governor General (<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"thyI9rUYptVMbpJA\">PHAM DINH</a>) and naval task force, and each colony has its own mayor.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Most of the discovered planets within their borders are resource poor, causing the UPP to constantly push deeper into the Frontier in search of rich, habitable worlds. As the UPP never developed atmospheric processors, they do not terraform. Instead, if a world is inhospitable, they will build a colony beneath the surface or construct habitation domes upon it. Because of this, the scattering of naturally habitable worlds the UPP has are overpopulated.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Notable worlds include New Kiev, Qi Xi III, 17 Phei Phei, Xiang Colony, and the Chiu and Wan An outposts.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The UPP is in a state of cold war with the United Americas. Over the past few decades, limited engagements have seen border worlds change hands or even be destroyed. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Some twenty years ago, a regime change on the independent world of 8 Eta Bo&ouml;tis A III led to what became known as the Tientsin campaign&mdash;a bloody conflict where the UA backed an independent planet&rsquo;s attempt to keep a UPP aligned government from taking power. The conflict decimated the once lush world and left it in ruins. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">More recently, the UPP are rumored to be behind the destruction of both the colony on LV-426 and a Colonial Marine rescue team. The allegations are that a UPP Space Operating Force nuked the site from orbit in response to a Weyland-Yutani bioweapon under development there. Ironically, while it was W-Y who accused the UPP of the attack, they also deny there were any bioweapons at Hadley&rsquo;s Hope. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Much of the UPP&rsquo;s more advanced technology appears to be reverse engineered from W-Y designs, something that neither Weyland-Yutani nor the UA are particularly happy about.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y AND O R G A N I Z A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<h3>SPACE OPERATING FORCES:</h3>\n<p>The elite commandos of the UPP are known as the Space Operating Forces. Said to be roughly equivalent to the United States Colonial Marines, the SOF has a similar regimental breakdown. They maintain a fleet of warships and transport vessels, have their own dropships, and use massive, two-story armored trucks for troop deployment. While the SOF have their own AK model pulse rifle, they also use wrist-mounted AK suit guns that allow hands free firing while wearing compression armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>MINISTRY OF SPACE SECURITY:</h3>\n<p>A national security agency and secret police, the MSS gathers both internal and external intelligence for the good of the Union of Progressive Peoples. The Ministry maintains a number of operatives throughout the Frontier, undercover on both UPP controlled worlds and United American colonies. MSS spies have infiltrated top corporations and stolen their military designs. They monitor their own citizenry to make sure they stay true to the Union. In the UPP, they say trust your enemy to be your enemy, but never trust your neighbor to be your friend. The MSS is why.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T&nbsp; A C T I V I T I E S</span></h1>\n<p>The people of the UPP are hungry. As the UPP discovers a new planet on the Frontier, colonization ships are immediately dispatched to help alleviate the overpopulation problem of their existing member worlds.</p>\n<p>Citizens don't get to decide who is moved to a new colony world. They are simply moved for the greater good of the Union.</p>\n<p>These expansionist tendencies have the United Americas concerned, and a large amount of Colonial Navy and Marine resources are devoted to protecting borders from UPP incursions.</p>\n<p>There have been many false alarms.</p>\n<p>Imagine the relief a two-man Colonial Marshal office feels when an armada of UPP ships entering a neighboring system turns out to be a colonization expedition and not a warfleet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"}

Increased carbon emissions, inappropriate disposal of toxic wastes, limited nuclear exchanges, and overpopulation led to the mass extinction of several species, rampant disease, environmental decay, a worldwide energy crisis, and famine. <br /><br />While stagnant governments were reluctant to change to meet these threats, multinational corporations headed by innovators like Peter Weyland stepped up and led the charge into the future. As many nations shut down their space programs, the private sector poured money and resources into pushing humanity out into the greater solar system and beyond. While politicians argued over global warming and health care, corporations set about repairing the ozone layer and curing most cancers. Establishing off-world colonies within the solar system, corporations gave humanity new places to flourish rather than wither on a damaged Earth. <br /><br />As Weyland-Yutani and other companies explored the stars, they established extrasolar colonies before there was any legislation in place to govern them. As these worlds flourished, it was the corporations that made policy. Realizing their technological dependence on companies like Weyland-Yutani to both travel to and terraform these planets in the first place, the governments of Earth had no choice but to play by company rules. At the mercy of these corporate overlords, nations soon found themselves in severe financial debt to them. <br /><br />Looking to the late 20th century&rsquo;s formation of the European Union for inspiration, the major countries of the world soon merged to form larger nations. Dire economic necessity coupled with diminishing resources soon led to the unprecedented political merging of cultures that had been at odds in the past. During the last quarter of the 21st century, the Three World Empire was formed. The United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples soon followed, and governments began to regain some semblance of their old power. But the military industrial complex, interstellar commerce, and deep space mining all keep the system going, and you need the corporations to take care of that. <br /><br /><em>Without them, the economy would collapse. </em><br /><br />The current depression on the Frontier is symptomatic of this political and corporate tug of war. Government control is an illusion, and it&rsquo;s a bad card trick at that. You can be assured that behind every politician is a corporate overlord exerting some form of control. <br /><br />What follows is a look at both the puppets and puppeteers of the 2180s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>THE COMPANY YOU KEEP:</h2>\n<p>Weyland-Yutani doesn&rsquo;t own everything, just mostly everything.

The two companies were so renowned for their corporate takeovers that the circumstances behind their merger became murky. While it is known that Weyland Corp had suffered severe financial losses with the failure of the Prometheus mission and the deaths of both company founder Peter Weyland and CEO Meredith Vickers, it is also true that Yutani had suffered many setbacks as well. <br />Conflicting insider information versus media reports make it questionable as to whether it was Yutani or Weyland who performed a hostile takeover on the other&mdash;and the company board likes it that way. The company inherited and expanded upon the technologies and products of its founders, including FTL drives, artificial intelligence, and deep surveillance equipment. Already leaders in the mining and shipping of extrasolar resources, by the 2130s they decided to get back into terraforming with a comparatively inexpensive and less safe redesign of Weyland Corp atmospheric processors. Over the next 30 years they established many new colony worlds within the American Arm of the Outer Rim Territories, in the process becoming the United Americas&rsquo; chief supplier of weapons and starships. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-color: black; width: 686px;\" border=\"0 \">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 395.6px;\">\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Like any major corporation, Weyland-Yutani is run by a board of directors and shareholders.

Around 140&ndash;150 personnel crew this lonely interstellar outpost which serves as a way station for long-distance freighters and survey ships as well as supporting in-system mining operations. <br /><br />The star system is dominated by a debris disc made up of millions of mineral-rich asteroids and planetoids. Scattered mining outposts search for deposits of tungsten and trimonite. <br /><br />Novgorod is typical of the small station designs currently available, perfectly suited to low-traffic regions and cheap to tow in and out again as the situation demands. <br /><br />Novgorod is very similar to dozens of other Seegson stations established along the Frontier and it serves as a useful model for other small space stations. <br /><br />As GM, you can use the layout and location descriptions for your own games, simply changing the name and/or location of the station to suit your current campaign.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">OVERVIEW</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Novgorod Station retains the \"tapering spire\" design of its much larger brethren. <br /><br />It has a wide, circular engineering base (A Deck), upon which are stacked nine increasingly smaller circular decks, for a total of ten. It can accommodate up to 40 visitors and can hard-dock with up to two starships at one time. Additional visiting vessels must stand-off and await transfer via the station&rsquo;s single Starcub-class shuttle. <br /><br />Running through the center of all decks is the Transit Tube, which houses two passenger elevators, emergency stairs and a restroom, as well as conduits and service pipes running between decks. Passengers are not allowed off the C Deck, the Concourse Deck, and the elevators will not operate for them. The elevators will only open on G Deck if the correct security level is held by the crewman. ID cards are slotted into the elevator controls to open the doors to that deck.The ten decks of the station are, from top to bottom:\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">J &ndash; Comms Platform:</strong> <br />Contains the communications and sensor equipment and a probe launching bay.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">I &ndash; Seegson Science Module:</strong> <br />Laboratories and offices rented by Seegson Corporation.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">H &ndash; Gustafsson Science Module:</strong> <br />Laboratories and offices rented by Gustafsson Enterprise.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">G &ndash; Upper Tower:</strong> <br />Contains the operations center as well as officer cabins and a restaurant.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">F &ndash; Lower Tower:</strong> <br />Contains the shuttle bay, fuel processor and station admin center.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">E &ndash; Hab Block:</strong> <br />Contains standard accommodation cabins, with caf&eacute; and store.

But no one knows where they are or what is going on. In fact, the Weyland-Yutani ship has no crew&mdash;none living, anyway. A twitchy android (an early Hyperdyne model 120-A2) has killed the entire crew, all down to conflicting orders that forbade it from revealing the true nature of the company mission. The android, Glynn, has been removed for study by the Seegson science lab, and the bodies are shortly due for disposal in space from the shuttle. The nature of the ship&rsquo;s mission is, however, still classified or unknown. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Secrets:</strong> The player characters stumble upon an on-station secret, perhaps involving the top secret mainframe experiments involving A.P.O.L.L.O. (See the Dr. Alicia Svenson character, below). The group can try to profit from this secret, which may involve a risk of fines, imprisonment or even death. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Jailbreak:</strong> The player characters are approached by a pilot. His buddy (a ship&rsquo;s engineer) has been arrested for fighting in the bar, and is likely to miss his ship&rsquo;s departure&mdash;losing him his job. Can they provide some kind of diversion to confuse or mislead the marshals, while the pilot frees the engineer from his cell down on B Deck? They will be amply compensated to the tune of thousands of dollars. The pilot is lying, the engineer has just turned state&rsquo;s evidence against his shipping company, and the pilot has orders to assassinate him in his cell. If the PCs assist, the pilot will vanish, leaving them to carry the can.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Shadow Games:</strong> A player character has something stolen from his room, perhaps a gun or camera, a flashlight, or bag. Then something is stolen from their ship, or from the room of another player character.\n<ul>\n<li>Are they being targeted?</li>\n<li>Why are these items being stolen?</li>\n</ul>\nThey must work with Marshal Otaka to catch the culprits, made harder by the investigation of a deluge of anti-Seegson graffiti across the station. There is a covert agent on-board, hired by Weyland-Yutani, who believes the PCs have been stealing company data and selling it on, possibly here at Novgorod. The agent is blackmailing one of the shuttle pilots who helped him get access to their ship, currently standing off from the station. He believes the data is hidden amongst personal items. When a Seegson agent contacts the group wanting to purchase their &lsquo;data&rsquo; things should get more confusing&mdash;and dangerous. Seegson believes, rightly or wrongly, that the PCs are data thieves and wants what they have! <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Strike:</strong> The spaceport shuts down because of a loaders&rsquo; strike due to a management dispute. This causes mild panic, arguments in the concourse and urgent talks behind closed doors. The chief loadmaster, Mallory Bourne, is fighting the loaders&rsquo; cause. There are some who are desperate to get off the station, perhaps because they have committed a crime. Will the PCs be tempted to help them? What other situations might occur during this worried time?

Well known for their award winning A.P.O.L.L.O. AI mainframe and low-end synthetics, Seegson first gained notoriety by sharing their inventions and pooling their resources with smaller companies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> One of the innovators of spaceflight in the 2030s, Sieg and Son was founded in direct competition to Weyland Corp. Having patented their own FTL displacement drive system, Sieg and Son shared their technologies with other companies, ensuring that Weyland wasn&rsquo;t the only one to make it to the stars. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">By the 2070s they were operating major production plants across the globe, the Sieg family had sold back their shares to the company and Sieg and Son was condensed to Seegson. The company entered the synthetic market in the early 2100s with their Working Joe model androids. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Nowhere near as advanced as Weyland&rsquo;s David or Walter series, the Working Joes have a more rudimentary intelligence and are designed to perform maintenance and menial tasks. Rather than being indistinguishable from humans, they have cheap rubberized skin that gives them the appearance of animate mannequins. Usable as an inexpensive labor force, the Working Joes sold well on the ever-shifting Frontier. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Successful in so many arenas, Seegson made one investment error that would cripple them for decades. Lacking a patent on atmospheric processors, Seegson put its funding into extrasolar deep space orbital platform colonies. As Weyland-Yutani terraformed more worlds, Seegson&rsquo;s stock began to plummet. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Even the harsher worlds proved more attractive to colonists than life inside a tin can floating through space. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">By 2140, most of Seegson&rsquo;s space stations had been placed on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Today, the company survives through its sales on backwater colonies and on the Frontier, where everything needs to be cheap and reliable. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Seegson is a publicly traded company run by a board of directors.

W-Y VP Brendan Lasalle quit over the firings, citing &ldquo;creative differences&rdquo; as the cause. He obtained start-up funds and assembled those laid off to create Lasalle Bionational. It wasn&rsquo;t long before his company acquired a lucrative government contract to produce an inexpensive, radiation-resistant corn substitute, as well as a blight virus that would destroy an enemy&rsquo;s crops, securing their place in the market. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Bionational is owned and operated by the Lasalle family, handed down from father to daughter <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"GhVT48kW4cJ8rc1C\">EDINA LASALLE</a>.

The company is known to operate several sterile research space stations in the Outer Veil and sponsored the colonies on Taurus 7 and LV-113 in the Outer Rim Territories. On the Frontier, Lassalle Bionational maintains a farming colony on Terraform 3 and operates a fleet of SEVs out of Anchorpoint Station. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Lasalle Bionational is in a bio-arms race with Weyland-Yutani to secure bioweapons contracts with the USCMC, and each is constantly the victim of corporate espionage and sabotage by the other. As Lasalle Bionational is not as well protected as W-Y, the UPP has placed spies within the Bionational administration with the intent of stealing their research for their own. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">P R O D U C T S</span></h1>\n<p>Lasalle Bionational is known for its radiation resistant crops, bioengineered livestock that can be customized to a number of different environments, extrasolar pathogen vaccines, and its biological research, procurement and weapons division.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T&nbsp; A C T I V I T I E S</span></h1>\n<p>Rivals to the Weyland-Yutani bio-weapons division, Lasalle Bionational has in fact managed to secure their own cache of Xenomorph XX121 ovomorphs and has successfully bred a hive for study and observation in the Taurus system. Bionational science and security exploration teams scour the Frontier looking for ancient Engineer laboratories, traces of Chemical A0-3959X.91-15, and any other alien lifeforms, viruses, or mutagens waiting to be discovered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"}

While the Outer Rim might be beyond the Outer Veil, the void is vast, and the Frontier cuts through the Outer Veil and Outer Rim before moving on into the unknown depths of space. Sectors which touch upon the Frontier include Tartarus, Bao Sau, and Sector 87. As such, some planets and systems on the Frontier are also located within those areas. Frontier stations such as Anchorpoint act as a neutral zone for all corporations and governments. Backwater colonies like Bowen&rsquo;s Landing, LV-492, and LV-422 lie on the Frontier along the Far Reach of the American Arm&mdash;an area of UA aggressive expansion that extends well past the Outer Rim. While part of the United Americas and protected by the Outer Rim Defense Fleet, mining and shipping hubs like Thedus and the Solomons are open to all entrepreneurs and pioneers. There are well-established star lanes to and from these distant worlds, but the space those routes cross through is between Frontier zones and therefore uncharted, unexplored, and dangerous. It&rsquo;s always recommended that ships stay at FTL speeds in these sectors.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">KHADAJI SYSTEM</h1>\n<p>The mineral rich Khadaji system was initially claimed and settled by the Three World Empire in the 2120s, but it was annexed to the United Americas thirty years later.</p>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><span class=\"KHADJI\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">KJ-331b Lebanon II:</strong> In orbit around the ringed gas giant KJ-331, Lebanon II is a moon on the brink of a revolution. Decades of shifting governmental allegiances hasn't helped the Wells colony prosper, but has instead helped line the pockets of many corporate execs. The Wells lies directly over a massive natural spring that produces fresh water with naturally occurring electrolytes&mdash;making it a favorite of the elite and sought after in the Inner Core Systems. <br />Contracts with several corporate concerns see that the moon is heavily mined for its water, iron, and uranium reserves which are sold at a premium while the colonists are forced to live in squalor. As petitions for better living standards have been ignored by the greater United American government, a small South American state has seen the plight of the Wells colony as a means to gain more power in the UA. As such, they have begun encouraging the rebels to sabotage supply lines while making demands for better wages and supplies.

However, when the moon was extensively surveyed in the 2130s, it was discovered that it had no indigenous life, calling the Nostromo rumors into question. <br />LV-426 is perhaps best known as the site of the doomed colony Hadley&rsquo;s Hope. Thirty-five years after the Nostromo incident, Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Administration set up an atmospheric processor on the swiftly turning moon and began terraforming procedures. The moon was renamed Acheron by its early settlers, and Hadley&rsquo;s Hope endured there for more than twenty years.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">The colony stopped transmitting reports in July of 2179, prompting a visit by a contingent of colonial marines. Whatever transpired next led to the nuclear annihilation of the colony and the death of both the colonial marine unit and all 158 colonists. What caused the destruction is uncertain&mdash;conflicting reports range from an attack by a rival government or unknown alien species to a simple reactor accident and meltdown. All that remains is a radioactive wasteland stretching over 700 km. <br />Soon after the incident, both Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Marines sent search and rescue teams to Acheron in the hopes of finding survivors. While the colony and the atmospheric processor were vaporized, it was theoretically possible that any colonists who made it as far as the Ilium Range would be protected from the blast by the mountains there. The company set up a relief station in orbit, but no survivors were ever found. Called Kathar Station, it is now a minor research platform maintained by a custodial staff.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"bigtable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Location</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Frontier, American Arm, near Tartarus Sector, orbiting Calpamos</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Weyland-Yutani, United Americas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Classification</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Terrestrial moon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Climate</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Breathable atmosphere, partially terraformed, high-velocity wind storms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Mean Temperature</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">10&deg;C (through terraforming)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Terrain</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Barren lava rock, mountains</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Colonies</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Odobenus Station in orbit, former site of Hadley's Hope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Population</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">Unknown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol1\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Key Resources</strong></td>\n<td class=\"scol5\">None identified</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\" style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">ACHERON: RUMOR CONTROL</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">Responding to what appeared to be a distress call in 2122, the Nostromo altered course and landed on LV-426.

Ship&rsquo;s first officer Kane was subsequently attacked by a facehugger and impregnated with a Plagiarus praepotens embryo which, when fully formed, began stalking the crew. With no Queen present, the alien initiated the ovomorphing transformation on Captain Dallas and technician Brett, converting their bodies into viable alien eggs. Third officer Ellen Ripley set the ship to self-destruct and escaped on the shuttlecraft Narcissus, finally killing the creature by blowing it out of the airlock and blasting it with a burst from the shuttle&rsquo;s engines. <br />In 2137, Captain Marlow of the deep space salvage vessel Anesidora also traced the signal back to the derelict, and shut it down&mdash;but not before his wife was impregnated by a facehugger.Decades passed.

For untold centuries they would ravage the grasslands for a season before going into hibernation for decades, only awakening when the lands were fertile once again. Between cycles, the company discovered the world and devised a method for creating self-replenishing crops there. The swarm awoke once more to devour everything. But with crops that could grow back after any attack, the swarm had no reason to go into hibernation. Instead their numbers grew exponentially until they blanketed the entire planet. The company was forced to bomb the planet with pesticides that rendered the planet uninhabitable.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">QUEEN:</strong> While severe in its solution, the problem was solved for LV-KR 115, but that was only the beginning. The term space locust seems to have been apt, as scientists have drawn a line across the Frontier of worlds that have suffered repeated ecological blights, and dormant swarms have been located adrift in deep space. It is possible that these insects drift in space for millennia before reaching new worlds to ravage. No one knows how many are out there, nor how many already lay dormant on fertile colony worlds, just waiting to wake up and begin the cycle again. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SWARM RULES:</strong> The size of a Swarm is measured in the number of zones it covers. The Speed rating of a Swarm is equal to the number of zones it covers. The Health of a Swarm is equal to 5 times the number of zones it covers. The Swarm cannot be killed. Victims can only flee from it or try to drive it off. If the Swarm&rsquo;s Health drops to zero it has had enough and goes looking for easier pickings. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Good luck. Try shooting them all you want, there are hundreds to take the place of every locust you might hit. In space, you can cook the dormant critters in your afterburners.

These large, fast moving burrowers have tiny, useless eyes, instead utilizing sonar to navigate. They have massive front claws and a mouth with a unique shredding mechanism that grinds organic materials and stores it in one of six stomachs. This mouth acts like a rotating circular meat grinder, crushing and pulping flesh, bone, plants, wood, rock and most metals. Only the strongest of materials will resist destruction, causing the Harvester to choke until the offending item is removed. <br />Typical targets of opportunity include farmlands, graveyards, food stores, or a gathering of people or animals. While Harvesters don&rsquo;t actually hunt living things, any creatures unlucky enough to be in their feeding zone are fodder. As the air in their natural habitat is higher in carbon dioxide than the human norm, Harvesters are capable of breathing in otherwise poisonous atmospheres. They carry their young beneath the folds of their armored shell&mdash;boar-sized creatures that will detach themselves and attack if their mother is overwhelmed.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">While native to Tartarus, some corporate exec at Bionational got it in his head that the Harvesters could be used to tunnel out mines on other metal rich worlds.

The sophistication of their fossilized biotechnology mystifies explorers while their megalithic stone statues and busts bear testament to their artistic and architectural superiority. <br /><br />But who are they? <br /><br />If the company has its way, you&rsquo;ll never find out. <br />Hieroglyphic tablets unearthed on Tanaka 5 call them Ossians. The decoded derelict beacon on LV-426 made reference to the Mala&rsquo;kak. Whatever they call themselves, to modern humans they are known simply as the Engineers. <br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw coined the term when she and Dr. Charles Holloway discovered pictograms on many of Earth&rsquo;s continents depicting giant beings pointing towards the stars. Believing the beings to have engineered humanity, she dubbed them accordingly. That star configuration turned out to be a star map which led the Prometheus mission to a distant moon and the ruins of an Engineer outpost. Whatever they found there was erased from the archives, the destination of the Prometheus was classified and all but forgotten&mdash;but stray transmissions picked up by company satellites confirmed the existence of the beings. <br /><br />Over the decades, covert corporate scientists have made attempts to classify them. Those with religious leanings have likened them to the Nephilim&mdash;fallen angels cast out of heaven for meddling with &mdash; or in this case creating&mdash;humanity. As the first remains of their kind were discovered at the helms of their dead ships, some have labeled them Mundus gubernavi, or &ldquo;universal pilot.&rdquo; <br />Like the misnomer Internecivus Raptus &mdash; &ldquo;murderous thief&rdquo; &mdash; that is sometimes associated with Xeno&shy;morph XX121, the classification, in and of itself, is incorrect. There is no &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; genus to draw upon. The late Doctor Shaw&rsquo;s scientific notes that were recovered in a garbled signal sent after the loss of the Prometheus provide the most shocking revelation about these Engineers&mdash;their DNA is human. They predate us, they are us, and we come from them. The re-discovery of Shaw&rsquo;s notes has led to a more scientific name for these giants&mdash;Homo Genitor, or &ldquo;creator of man.&rdquo; <br /><br />The little more that is known about them has been gleaned from several extrasolar archeological digs discovered within the past three years as the Frontier has advanced into the unknown. No living Engineers are known to exist&mdash;and the few xenoanthropologists aware of them believe they died out thousands of years ago. Their passing is marked by their abandoned citadels, derelict ships, and their biogenetic and evolutionary experiments. <br /><br />What is also clear from Dr. Shaw&rsquo;s transmissions is that even though they created humanity, at some point millennia ago they decided to undo their creation &mdash; attempting to wipe out the Earth and start again.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">PHYSICAL TRAITS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">The Engineers were colossal beings.

This is in fact a removable living pressure suit that melds with the Engineer&rsquo;s body, with the &ldquo;head&rdquo; actually being a helmet of some type.

They have hairless, chiseled physiques with translucent blue-white skin, heavy brows, high noses, and large, glassy black eyes. They are both beautiful and powerful in appearance. While they were once believed to be all male, there is now evidence to suggest that female Engineers exist as well.

Different flutes function as keys to unlock different doors and technology, and playing different tones on these flutes will trigger different functions, such as turning on the lights, starting a juggernaut, plotting a navigational course, or even unlocking a biosuit. <br />An android or human possessing a particular talent for music could conceivably learn to whistle the appropriate tones to activate and operate Engineer technology, but it is an exceedingly difficult skill to master. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ENGINEER BIOSUIT:</strong> It has been theorized that these pressure suits increase the wearer&rsquo;s strength, help them to process toxins, and act as armor against ballistic weaponry. Helmeted, one of these suits will keep an Engineer alive in the vacuum of space. Scientists believe an engineer could survive in a toxic environment for at least one hour sans helmet, as the biosuit will breath for them. The biosuit also acts as an advanced medkit, repairing damage to the Engineer&rsquo;s body and providing the wearer with limited sustenance. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ENGINEER REBREATHER:</strong> Usually used by Engineers when placed in cryosleep, these bioengineered masks insert a tube down the wearer&rsquo;s throat and feed oxygen directly to their lungs. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SARCOPHAGI:</strong> Resembling large, translucent coffins, these Engineer hypersleep tubes can keep someone alive in suspended animation for centuries, if not millennia. An Engineer rebreather must be worn while in the chamber. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">HOLOGRAPHY:</strong> Engineers record everything within their installations using a memory gel that coats the interior walls and ceiling. When the proper electrostatic currents are channeled through the gel, holographic playback will occur in the actual environment, producing fuzzy, blue particle representations of various recorded events. Most evidence of the Engineer&rsquo;s past actions have come from such recordings.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ORRERY:</strong> Engineer holographic maps of the galaxy are extremely detailed and interactive, allowing viewers to simply pluck a photonic representation of a world out of the air and have its statistics and coordinates feed directly into a navigational system. Orreries are located on the bridge of an Engineer ship and sometimes serve as observatories or command centers within Engineer installations. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">JUGGERNAUTS:</strong> These massive, asymmetrical, horseshoe-shaped craft appear more grown than built. Each ship contains at least one massive cargo bay with an ampule delivery system (see the ampule entry below). These ships usually have four to eight hypersleep chambers arranged around a central dais on the upper level of the ship&rsquo;s center. In the middle of this dais is a retractable pilot's seat that interfaces with the pilot and makes them one with the ship. The entire chamber can be used to display a map of the galaxy, homing in on any world or system and charting a course to the desired location. Juggernauts are theorized to be war machines or bombers of some kind and are capable of FTL speeds that rival our own. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">MOTHER JUGGERNAUT:</strong> Colossal craft shaped like a scorpion&rsquo;s tail, Engineer motherships are defensive docking stations that hover over and protect major Engineer installations and cities. Juggernauts and other Engineer craft can dock with a Mothership to replenish their energies and supplies. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">DREADNOUGHTS:</strong> While none have yet to be seen, Dreadnoughts are hypothetical Engineer battleships. Partially translated hieroglyphics seem to indicate that these twisted, knot-shaped craft are larger than juggernauts but still follow the same design philosophy. Dreadnoughts are believed to be extremely weaponized and FTL capable. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">STEATITE AMPULES:</strong> Metallic storage containers roughly a half a meter tall, these urns each contain four glass conical containers&mdash;each of which in turn contains a strain of the Engineer&rsquo;s greatest creation&mdash;the genetic accelerant called Agent A0-3959X.91-15.

Unfortunately, the most prolific species on the planet is a small arthropod that is similar to lice, making it mandatory that all visitors shave their body hair. Fury 161&rsquo;s year is only ten days long&mdash;and half of that year is in darkness. Determined to be rich in platinum, the planet was extensively mined for decades. Estimates proved to be optimistic, however, and Fury 161&rsquo;s resources tapped out quickly. Never one to miss a beat, Weyland-Yutani converted the worksite to a Class C Work Correctional Unit and lead works for radioactive and toxic waste disposal, leasing it to the Three World Empire.

During the Hadley&rsquo;s Hope Incident on LV-426, an alien Queen managed to come aboard the USS Sulaco and deposit at least one undeveloped egg sac aboard the ship before being expelled from the airlock by mission advisor Lt. Ellen Ripley. As the Sulaco&rsquo;s computers were subsequently damaged, it is unclear if there were one or two facehuggers birthed aboard at the time&mdash;but what is clear is that one was able to produce a royal embryo. Once the unsuspecting survivors entered hypersleep, the newly hatched creature attempted to gain entry to Jorden&rsquo;s cryotube, accidentally causing an electrical fire in the Sulaco&rsquo;s hypersleep chambers. The ship&rsquo;s MU/TH/UR ejected the EEV pod, launching Ripley, Corporal Hicks, Rebecca Jorden, and the Sulaco&rsquo;s Bishop android towards Fury 161. Their pod eventually crashed into the ocean near the correctional facility. Hicks and Jorden did not survive the crash, and the Bishop android was damaged beyond repair. Lt. Ripley was soon found to be gestating a Queen within her. Either the royal facehugger was able to produce two embryos&mdash;an ability that W-Y scientists have hypothesized but been unable to confirm&mdash;or a second facehugger was also aboard the EEV with them. Regardless of the culprit, one of the facility&rsquo;s domestic animals was subsequently impregnated with the Runner variety of p.praepotens. The Runner managed to slaughter all the convicts and staff except for Morse and prison guard Francis Aaron. Because of the unborn Queen Ripley carried, the Runner left her unmolested. Aware that the lieutenant was a carrier, Weyland-Yutani dispatched CEO Michael Bishop and a crack medical team to retrieve the embryo.

Ripley that were taken by Dr. Clemens before her death, no viable p.praepotens genetic material was found. The company ordered the site closed and put the equipment there up for sale as scrap.Not all the quinitricetyline was used up in the inmates&rsquo; bid to rid the prison of the star beast. While most of the facility on Fury 161 has been stripped and prepped for scrap, Weyland-Yutani has yet to find any buyers for it&mdash;and that includes the remaining drums stored there. But that&rsquo;s not all.The Weyland-Yutani team assigned to comb the facility wasn&rsquo;t as thorough as they could have been&mdash;likely because their corporate masters were reluctant to explain exactly what they were looking for. Deep in the bowels of the long abandoned sections of the facility lie the beginnings of a secreted resin hive. Just as the Drone Xenomorph aboard the Nostromo had done with Dallas and Brett, the Fury 161 Runner had been creating a nest and had already begun the process of transforming Superintendent Andrews and inmates Boggs and Rains into contingency ovomorphs. <br />Other parties have since taken interest in Morse&rsquo;s Space Beast, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone sends their own covert team to investigate.

Znoy is but one of many such posts across the UPP border, all connected by a grid of sensor satellites that record any incursions. Unfortunately, the sensors are rudimentary at best, so it is often difficult for the outpost staff to determine if an invasion fleet is on its way or if the grid has simply registered a rogue comet or stellar debris. While new arrivals here scramble to alert the UPP SOF Command of any contact, old timers know the drill. Znoy Outpost is mostly underground, having been driven into the rock like a giant stake.

It is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area. While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations. To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley&rsquo;s Hope.

It is believed that an ecological disaster there brought on by the release of Agent A0-3959X.91-15 in the atmosphere led to the accelerant settling on and mutating native fungal and insect life to produce a living nightmare. Similar to a Xeno­morph XX121, the Neomorph parasite (P. celerius) is delivered to a host via a carrier organism (Tachinidae tabellarium). Once implanted, the parasite gestates within a living host who is killed by the creature’s violent birth.

The injected Agent A0-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall. This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass—such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster. <br />If lodged in a region of the body with dense muscle or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host—using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew. The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster. <br />Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours. These rabid quadrupedal creatures rely on their speed and agility to avoid damage. Emerging about 0.3 meters in length, Bloodbursters continue to grow exponentially, visibly getting larger as they move about. Highly aggressive, they lash out at anything and everything around them. They use their claws, tail, and teeth to savagely maul their victims.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> A patient entering Stage III is immediately killed outright by the birth of the Bloodburster. The newly born Bloodburster takes one Round to sluggishly free itself from its amniotic sack. As soon as it is free, it flies into a savage rage and attacks any living creature it encounters.

The alien shifts from egg to parasitic Facehugger to embryonic Chestburster to adult creature and beyond before beginning the cycle anew. While it has been classified inaccurately as either Invictus raptus or Linguafaeda acheronis by the few in the scientific community to have observed the alien and survived, recent research seems to indicate that Xeno­morph XX121 is actually comprised of two separate species—the Facehugger (Manumala noxhydria) that inseminates a host, and the rapidly maturing Chestburster creature (Plagiarus praepotens) that results from that act—both operating together in a symbiotic relationship. Allegedly blind, the alien still has keen senses and can detect even the slightest movement. These biomechanoid creatures shed their cells and replace them with polarized silicon, essentially growing their own refractive armor. They have highly caustic concentrated acid for blood and deadly prehensile tails. Immensely strong in their adult forms, a Plagiarus Drone or Soldier can easily lift a man by the head and crush his skull in its hands. <br />As to their origins, no one can be certain. Some believe them to be biological weapons created by some bygone race, possibly the enigmatic and godlike Engineers, while others believe they are a naturally evolved species that the Engineers themselves worshipped. Some religious cults take that a step further, believing the aliens were sent here by God or gods to exact divine retribution on humanity for leaving our solar system and daring to enter the heavens. Still others believe that humanity had a hand in the creatures’ creation, and that they are a corporate experiment run amok. What is for certain is that they are dangerous to everyone. They are a parasitic plague that is working its way across the Frontier, and Weyland-Yutani, as well as other corporations, want to find a way to control and weaponize them for profit.</p>\n<br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>A NOTE FROM MU/TH/UR.</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">It’s important to note that different Xeno­morph XX121 strains have different traits, and that the information provided here is based on the latest xenobiological information.

Each type of Xeno­morph inflicts a different level of acid splash damage. Only damage that draws blood causes an acid splash—hence a fire attack does not have this effect. The bigger the Xeno­morph, and the more damage it has taken, the greater the splash. <br />The strength of an acid splash is based on the Acid Splash rating of the Xeno­morph plus the amount of damage that the Xeno took from the attack, in Base Dice, with base Damage 1. Armor reduces the damage, but for each <span class=\"basesymbol\"> </span> rolled, its Armor Rating is reduced by one, as the acid eats through it. The acid blood will also affect the environment, and may splash nearby ammo and grenades, or burn through floors, wiring, a ship’s hull, and so on (at GM’s discretion). <br />The acid blood continues to burn after the initial splash. A victim who suffers damage from the initial splash suffers another attack each Round, at the start of the Round, just like for fire damage (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-playerguide\" data-id=\"5Oda1OfYXdSrZqaO\">OTHER HAZARDS</a>). However, the number of Base Dice rolled for the attack is halved (rounding fractions down) at the start of each new Round, as the acid is slowly used up. If at any point an acid attack roll fails to inflict any damage the acid has burned itself out and the acid effect is over. <br />If a victim is Broken by the acid splash, or suffers further acid splash damage when already Broken, they must make a Death Roll every Round until they either die or are saved by a <strong>MEDICAL AID</strong> roll.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SPRINT:</strong> All Xeno­morph XX121 varieties except Stage I can, as a slow action, sprint as if having used two run actions—i.e., through two zones or from an adjacent zone directly into <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range of a target. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RESISTANCE TO VACUUM:</strong> The resilient physiology of Xeno­morph XX121 offers it total protection against the vacuum of space. As such, the Xeno can act indefinitely in such an environment without suffering any ill effects. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FALLING:</strong> The Xeno­morphs are beautifully adapted for climbing and jumping. As such, they can fall from great heights without suffering any damage. Falling damage taken by a Xeno­morph is equal to the distance fallen in meters divided by 4 (rounding fractions down), reduced by Armor. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IMMUNE TO THE COLD:</strong> Cold temperatures seem to have no effect on a Xeno­morph. Even the frigid gulf of space does not hinder them in any way. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">RADIATION:</strong> Xeno­morph XX121 has proven extremely resistant to all forms of radiation. They can suffer 10 Rads before feeling any ill effects—i.e. the first 10 points suffered are ignored from any radiation rolls). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">NO RESPIRATION:</strong> For all intents and purposes, a Xeno­morph does not need to breathe, at least, not in any way that has currently been observed. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">NO HEAT SIGNATURE:</strong> Xeno­morph XX121 does not register on infrared or thermographic sensors.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">A Xeno­morph with an Acid Splash rating of 8 takes a huge hit, suffering five points of damage from a Smart Gun on auto-fire.

They come in various sizes from 0.6 to 1.2 meters tall. While most open with four petals at the top, some only have a single slit that opens to reveal the Facehugger it carries within. These eggs are lifeforms in their own right, able to protect their precious cargo from blunt trauma and forced entry, while also sensing movement and awakening the parasite within accordingly. Naturally occurring alien eggs are generated in one of two forms—either they are the result of a transformation perpetrated on a living host, causing it to metamorphose into an Ovomorph, or they are simply birthed by a Queen. Queen produced eggs are hardier and healthier than those produced through ovomorphing.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">OPENING THE EGG:</strong> If a potential host comes within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range of an Ovomorph, the host must make a <strong>MOBILITY</strong> roll each Round to not disturb it. If it fails, the egg will open and release a Facehugger. An Ovomorph can release its Facehugger even at <strong>SHORT</strong> range—roll a Stress Dice each Round.

It will then cocoon its victims in a secreted saliva resin, introducing a series of enzymes and growth hormones to the hosts in order to transform them into alien eggs. <br />This process is called ovomorphing. Using the developing barb on its bladed tail, the Drone inserts genetic material from M. noxhydria into the host’s eggmorphing body, allowing the newly formed egg to incubate a new Facehugger and thus continuing the alien’s life cycle. If conditions are right, a new Queen will be along in short order. The ovomorphing process typically takes 24–36 hours (four to six Shifts) to complete.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<h1 class=\"headng\">STAGE II: FACEHUGGER</h1>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Manumala noxhydria is a parasitic form of Xeno­morph designed for one task only—the implantation of Plagiarus bacteria within a living host. Coming in a variety of sickly yellowish to brown flesh tones, a Facehugger has a small body, eight spider or crab-like fingers, two large breathing sacks, and a long and powerful tail which it uses to spring itself onto a startled host’s face. The Facehugger clutches its fingers around the victim's head, wraps its tail around their throat, and emits an anesthetic that renders the host unconscious, before inserting its proboscis down the creature’s throat. There are several different Facehugger types which appear to vary only slightly in appearance. The major difference is the type of seed they carry—be it for a Praetomorph, Xeno­morph Drone, or Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FACEHUGGER AND Praeto-Facehugger:</strong> These typical creatures are described above. The Praeto-Facehugger is slightly bigger than the standard one but otherwise functions the same and is less dexterous. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">ROYAL FACEHUGGER:</strong> The royal variety of Facehugger has eight webbed fingers and is much larger than the standard type. Armored, it also possesses two serrated fingertips and a bladed tail with which to defend itself. Some specimens have also been known to have spikes on their back and spots on their air bladders. While it is theorized that a regular Facehugger can produce a P. praepotens with the ability to transmute into a Queen if necessary, the larger and more powerful Royal Facehuggers are known to specifically produce Queens, and hypothesized to carry not one but two P. praepotens spores—allowing the royal Facehugger to not only produce a Queen, but also a protector for the newborn royalty.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">EMBRYO IMPLANTATION:</strong> Weyland-Yutani surgical scientist Dr. Matshuita believes that a Facehugger deposits a Chestburster embryo within its victim, making them the same species. Others believe what is deposited to be a cancerous growth that mutates and transforms into a Chestburster, while former W-Y geneticist Dr. Blue Grace Marsalis hypothesized a controversial third theory. Dr. Marsalis believes there is a symbiotic relationship between the Facehugger and the Chestburster, calling the former Manumala noxhydria and the later P. praepotens. She postulated that it is neither an embryo nor an implanted cancer, but an injected bacteria that is the beginnings of P. praepotens. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FACEHUGGING:</strong> The Stage II Xeno will automatically facehug any immobilized potential host within <strong>ENGAGED</strong> range. In combat, a successful signature attack #6 will do the trick. If the victim is facehugged, the Xeno­morph infects its host via its proboscis, inseminating them deep within their chest cavity. There the host’s own cells mutate to form and incubate the Xeno­morph until its next stage. The victim is rendered unconscious. Within one Shift, the Facehugger dies and falls off. The victim wakes up, typically very hungry. After another Shift has passed, a Chestburster (Stage III) is born, killing the host. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> A Facehugger is incredibly fast and strong for its size, and in most cases it cannot be removed from a host’s face without killing the host itself. While its polarized silicon skin protects it from most forms of melee attack, it is helpless against pulse rounds and laser tools. Again, fire works wonders.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>FACEHUGGER</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">FACEHUGGER</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">PRAETO-FACEHUGGER</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">ROYAL FACEHUGGER</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">6</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">8</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">4</td>\n<td class=\"oddcol1\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>FACEHUGGER ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1-2</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">SKITTERING MENACE: The Facehugger has chosen its host and they know it is coming for them!

While most hosts feel sick to their stomach as the parasite grows within them, some comment that they feel better than they have in ages. As the organs of the host are transformed into the embryonic alien, the host’s ribcage is also softened to a point where the Chestburster can perform the act after which it is named. Gestation complete, the creature erupts from the host, killing it from a combination of massive tissue damage, blood loss, and organ transformation. A newly birthed alien exhibits different traits depending on its type. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CHESTBURSTER:</strong> Jaundiced beige in color, the snake-like Chestburster has a mouth full of metallic canines. Depending on the length of gestation, a Chestburster will either be born with tiny arms or stubs where the arms will eventually grow in. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BAMBI BURSTER:</strong> Otherwise similar to the Chestburster, this fawn-like creature is the result of an alien embryo developing within a quadrupedal host. As animals generally mature at a faster rate than humans, the Bambi-burster is birthed with four spindly legs that it uses to propel itself at great speeds. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">IMP:</strong> The immature form of a Praetomorph, the Imp has translucent skin, a carapace and rawboned features that make it look very much like a miniature version of its adult form. If an Imp doesn’t feel threatened upon emergence, it will sometimes mimic the actions of the nearest creature. Like all Praetomorph stages, Imps mature at a substantially faster rate than traditional Chestbursters.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">QUEENBURSTER:</strong> An embryonic queen, the Stage III Xeno­morph nicknamed the Queenburster gestates over days instead of hours. When born, the creature has a partially formed crest on its head, both sets of arms, and fully developed legs. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">BIRTH:</strong> The birth of the Chestburster kills the host outright. The Chestburster has evolved to make a shocking display immediately after birth as a defense mechanism: it snarls, hisses and squeals whilst spraying the blood of its host in all directions. People who witness this for the first time must make an immediate Panic Roll. Within one Shift, the Chestburster evolves to Stage IV. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Surgical attempts to remove an embryonic Chestburster to date have resulted in the death of the patient—and depending on how far along it is into the gestation period—the death of the alien as well. Despite being able to defend itself, at this stage the Xeno­morph is at its most vulnerable. It is easily killed by gunshots, explosives, knives, and fire—if it can be caught. Once birthed it will immediately seek both a place to hide and a source of raw metals to consume in order to complete the transformation into an adult—in addition to organic foods, aliens eat metals to increase their mass. Sufficiently fed, the Chestburster will begin to darken in color and shed its skin, cocooning itself in resin for the metamorphosis to the next Stage.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>VARIABLE GESTATION</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">While under normal circumstances each Plagiarus species has a typical gestation period, various factors can retard or accelerate the process.

Being infected while in hypersleep can slow the process upon revival, and being placed in stasis while infected will arrest the infection or incubation until the afflicted is awakened. It is ultimately up to the Game Mother and the needs of the story to decide how rapid any xenovirus gestation period is.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>FACEHUGGER</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">CHESTBURSTER</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">BAMBI BURSTER</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">IMP</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">QUEENBURSTER</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2 (0 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">0 (3 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4 (2 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>CHESTBURSTER ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1-3</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ESCAPE: With a snarl the Chestburster flees, moving two zones away in one action, into the nearest vent, sewer or duct if possible.

Their now fully polarized skin is near black in tone; they have a bladed prehensile tail, six-fingered hands with enlarged nails, pronounced ribs, and translucent to opaque smooth-domed heads. In addition to their metallic, toothy mouths, they have an inner set of jaws that can strike like a piston—a favored mode of attack. <br />Save for the Scout, Stage IV Xeno­morphs have four dorsal tubes affixed to their backs. While some have theorized the tubes are used for spinning and cocooning the resin for their hive, that has generally been discounted as a fallacy. The current line of thinking is that the tubes are a type of breathing apparatus, filtering out airborne toxins and allowing the creatures to breath underwater. However, as Aliens have been observed surviving in the vacuum of space, it is possible that they do not need to breathe at all. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">STALKER:</strong> Averaging about 2.7 meters tall and comfortable moving on two legs as well as all four, Stalkers are the highly aggressive adult form of the Praetomorph. Classified as Plagiarus linesteres, the Praetomorph is a variant breed of Xeno­morph XX121. The Stalker is believed to be an evolutionary dead end for the Praetomorph, as no encountered specimen has ever metamorphosed further. Unlike its phylogenetic relative P. praepotens, the P. linesteres does not appear to have a Queen stage. It also differs in that it has no biomechanical endoskeleton, and its teeth are translucent bone instead of metal. They are bigger, more powerful, resilient, and more resistant to fire than standard Xenos—they just happen to be less intelligent and more animalistic in nature <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SCOUT:</strong> 2.1 meters tall when standing upright, the brown-black Scout or Runner is a particularly fast adaptation of P. praepotens. Usually moving about on all fours, the Scout’s job is to seek out a nearby source of hosts and alert the hive when one is found. If no hive yet exists, the scout will begin capturing hosts and cocooning them for ovomorphing until a Queenburster is produced. Once the Queen is birthed and a hive location is secure, a Scout will metamorphose to its next stage. For reasons unknown, Scouts have no dorsal tubes—they do not develop them until Stage V.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">DRONE:</strong> Sometimes called Lurkers, Drones stand 2.4 meters tall, and are stealthy ambush hunters. Their tails end in a deadly hooked blade and rudimentary barb for Ovomorph injection. In many ways, Drones are the most alien of the species. It is theorized that the strange behavior often exhibited by Drones is due to them reaching young adulthood without establishing a connection to the alien hive mind. The stealthy creatures’ fluid yet awkward movements and unorthodox reactions to stimuli belie their methodical intelligence. The ebon Drone is a clever yet single-minded iteration of the Xeno­morph. Development of P. praepotens will arrest at Stage IV unless a Queen’s pheromones cause it to molt into a Worker or Soldier—whichever form the hive is most in need of. Until then it will eat, gather hosts for ovomorphing, and sleep. When it evolves to the next stage, it joins the hive mind. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SILENT ASSASSIN [DRONE ONLY]:</strong> When making a stealth mode roll or sneak attack from within the same zone, the Drone is so silent that its target gets a –2 modification to their <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> test. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">FERAL HUNGER [STALKER ONLY]:</strong> The Stalker has an insatiable need to kill. If it makes an attack that causes damage it will immediately make a second attack (with eight Base Dice, Damage 1) against the same target as a free action. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong> Stage IV Xenos are notoriously difficult to kill. They operate outside of the alien hive mind and are independent—but each exhibits traits that can be exploited. Drones follow a routine and spend most of their time hibernating in warm places such as somewhere close to a reactor core—and can be hunted down accordingly.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>STALKER, SCOUT, DRONE</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Stalker</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Scout</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Drone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">3</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">5</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10 (5 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8 (4 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>STALKER, SCOUT &amp; DRONE ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">HYPNOTIZING GAZE: The Xeno­morph, eyeless as it may seem, stares deeply into the soul of its victim.

Their now fully polarized skin is near black in tone; they have a bladed prehensile tail, six-fingered hands with enlarged nails, pronounced ribs, and translucent to opaque smooth-domed heads. In addition to their metallic, toothy mouths, they have an inner set of jaws that can strike like a piston—a favored mode of attack. <br />Save for the Scout, Stage IV Xeno­morphs have four dorsal tubes affixed to their backs. While some have theorized the tubes are used for spinning and cocooning the resin for their hive, that has generally been discounted as a fallacy. The current line of thinking is that the tubes are a type of breathing apparatus, filtering out airborne toxins and allowing the creatures to breath underwater. However, as Aliens have been observed surviving in the vacuum of space, it is possible that they do not need to breathe at all. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SOLDIER:</strong> Romantically referred to as a Warrior, a Soldier Xeno­morph is the adult form of a Drone. As the alien matures, the creature’s dome loses its form and melds with the ridged tissues beneath it. The alien’s head begins to polarize and harden, forming an armored carapace. Blades will begin to grow from the Xeno’s elbows, and its hands will mutate into five-fingered claws, dropping the sixth digit. Blue-black in color, Soldiers are nimble and attack en masse. The Soldier’s tail has a barb at the end with a toxin that can cause paralysis in most known lifeforms. Once incapacitated, the Soldier will carry its prey back to the hive to be impregnated by a Facehugger. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">WORKER:</strong> The diminutive Workers build and maintain the hive. Also called Weavers, they produce and spin the resin of the hive with their long proboscis tongues, shape it with their hands and feet, position eggs near cocooned hosts, and feed and maintain the Queen. Physically, they are somewhat different than the other members of P. praepotens. Transformation from Drone to Worker will see an alien shrink to between 1.2 and 1.8 meters in height. Its skin will turn a sickly grayish white, while its tongue grows pink, elongates, and develops a funnel through which it will secrete the makings of the hive. Workers ignore threats within the hive and will run if threatened, leaving their protection to Soldiers and Sentries.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">SENTRY:</strong> SENTRY: After Scouts have secured a hive and a source of hosts, they mature into Sentries. Like Soldiers, their carapaces become ridged and armored. They are still incredibly fast and dexterous, with specialized gripping hands and feet that allow them to scale walls and ceilings with greater efficiency than other Xenos. Attuned to their Queen’s needs, they will back off or attack as she signals. Also called Defenders, Sentries will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to keep hive invaders at bay and protect their Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong><br />As always, fire keeps Xeno­morphs at bay. <br />The non-aggressive Workers are easy to take down as they offer little resistance. A Soldier’s carapace is armored enough to shrug off regular ammunition rounds, but pulse rifles make short work of them. Soldiers tend to work in groups, overwhelming targets with sheer numbers. Because of this, it is possible to take out a large number of them with an area effect weapon, hopefully evening the odds a bit. Sentries will not leave the inner hive unless the Queen does, so stay out of there and you’ll easily avoid them. You know what? Just stay out of an alien hive. <br />Period.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>SOLDIER, WORKER, SENTRY</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Soldier</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Worker</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">Sentry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SPEED</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">2</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">HEALTH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">SKILLS</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n<td class=\"scol7\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">MOBILITY</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">OBSERVATION</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">8</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">4</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ARMOR RATING</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10 (5 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">5 (2 Vs Fire)</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">12 (5 Vs Fire)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"scol7\">ACID SPLASH</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">6</td>\n<td class=\"scol7\">10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<table class=\"stable\"><caption><strong>SOLDIER &amp; SENTRY ATTACKS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">D6</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ATTACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"die\">1</td>\n<td class=\"scol3\">ASSESSING THE THREAT: The Xeno­morph pauses, hissing quietly but all the more threatening for that.

Their immense size and crested carapaces mark them as the leaders of their hive. Stronger and smarter than those beneath them, Stage VI Xenos command alien armies. These Stages are only reached when an existing Queen produces royal jelly and exposes her Soldiers and Sentries to it. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">PRAETORIAN:</strong> When a hive reaches a population of over 300 individuals, Workers feed the Queen’s chosen warriors with Royal Jelly until the transformation to Praetorian takes place. The penultimate form of an alien Soldier, Praetorians grow up to twice the height of their brethren. They develop a head crest similar to a Queen’s, but maintain a more standardized bipedal form with only two arms. Lead protectors of the hive, Praetorians are the Queen’s Royal Guards and army commanders. It is theorized that if a hive loses its Queen, a Praetorian can molt into a new one. If this happened before another hive invaded, the old hive can be preserved. If not, the invaders take advantage of the leaderless Xenos and claims them for their own Queen. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CHARGER:</strong> Also called the Crusher, the Charger is the Xeno­morph equivalent of a tank. After being force-fed Royal Jelly and raw metals by the Queen’s workers for weeks, a bloated Sentry will cocoon itself in resin and undergo a massive transformation. Its quadrupedal stance is bulked up and its head grows a massive, armored chitinous crest similar to a Queen’s. Chargers grow to stand between 1.8 and 3 meters tall at the shoulder. Heavy defensive protectors of the hive, the Crusher will charge an enemy like a rabid rhino, trampling personnel and plowing through even lightly armored vehicles. Essentially the Runner variant of the Praetorian, the Charger’s mobility is limited in that it cannot climb or jump very well. Luckily, they are relatively rare and only appear in long established hives</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">QUEEN:</strong> The mother of the hive, at six meters tall or more, the alien Queen is perhaps the strongest and most intelligent of the species. While any adult alien is capable of initiating ovomorphing in a host organism, only Queens have the ability to lay eggs en masse. When her first molt is completed and the Queen is fertile, her Workers spin a resin cradle that holds her suspended above the floor of the hive. The Queen then grows an enormous egg sac that soon becomes distended and engorged with developing eggs. As each new Ovomorph is ready, she deposits it on the ground via ovipositor for her Workers to spirit away to nearby cocooned hosts. <br />The most astonishing thing about the Queen is her ability to communicate with her hive. While evidence exists to suggest she does so via a combination of pheromones and subsonic vocalizations, there are company consultants who believe she communicates telepathically as well, “speaking” with her children over immeasurable distances. In fact, corporate psychiatrists have documented that employees who score high on their company esper tests and find themselves within the proximity of an alien hive will have vivid dreams of the Queen calling to them, whether they are aware of her existence or not. <br />Additionally, professional dreamers seem to have a hard time producing after being exposed to an alien Queen. Of course, this could simply be a form of PTSD, but it bears further investigation. An alien Queen’s distinguishing characteristics include her size, her large crested head, set of six dorsal spikes (instead of tubes), unique stance and a second set of grasping arms. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">CONTAINMENT AND TERMINATION PROTOCOL:</strong><br />A Charger is nigh invulnerable while charging with its head shield down, but its body is only as armored as that of a regular alien Soldier, and well-placed explosives or heavy artillery will make short work of the beast. While they have few weaknesses, taking out a Praetorian will temporarily disorient the Soldiers it coordinates. <br />As for dealing with the Queen… yeah. <br /><br />Don’t.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\"> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>ROYAL JELLY</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">Secreted by a Xeno­morph Queen, Royal Jelly is a gelatinous substance that a mother Xeno uses to shape the Sentries of her hive.

Hives are full of twisting and confusing biomechanical tunnels and corridors that have been spun and crafted by Worker aliens. The damp, muted green-gray walls make it easier for P. praepotens to climb and maneuver, and are full of ridges and pockets for alien Soldiers to hide in. The sticky walls also serve another purpose—hosts are cocooned and impregnated within them until they birth a Chestburster and are killed. The hosts’ decaying bodies then grows into the resin, serving as nourishment for the Workers and Soldiers of the hive. The atmosphere inside the hive is usually hot, dank and humid, and the putrid smell is unbearable. Soldiers lay dormant, hibernating in the walls and on the ceiling until called to task by their Queen.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\"> </td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">Along the way there are many small chambers that serve unknown purposes, and deep within the nest’s maze is a centralized and guarded chamber where the Queen sits atop a bloated egg sac and deposits her eggs. Some hives have been found to contain diluted derivative pools of Chemical A0-3959X.91-15, likely secreted by the Xeno­morphs themselves and used to perform genetic alterations on hosts in order to make them more suitable for the production of the type of Chestbursters the hive needs most.

While independent from each other, member colonies sell and trade resources and pay fees to be protected by corporate armed forces. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The corporate owned Central Space Consortium of the ICSC is seen as a haven for those on the run from their government. If someone with a skill set useful to a corporate colony comes seeking asylum within the CSC, the Consortium will usually buy off that person&rsquo;s tribunal and make them an indentured citizen. In this way, corporations bolster their private mercenary forces and spy networks with the best of the worst elements of society.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Once known as the CSC, or Central Space Consortium, this sector was first formed in the 2080s by corporations looking for a way to avoid paying taxes to their earthbound governments. Establishing major holdings on off-world colonies, these corporations declared their independence and created their own laws. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Companies like Weyland-Yutani, Seegson, Chigusa, Hyperdyne, and the Jĭngt&igrave; L&oacute;ng Corporation all have planetary holdings in the CSC. As humanity&rsquo;s reach stretched into the Outer Rim during the 2100s, more and more UA and 3WE colonies became dissatisfied with the support they received from their governments. Colonial administration was understaffed and overworked. Supply lines were late and the marines and marshals were spread too thin. Some colonies decided to declare themselves independent, but with no corporate giant behind them, they soon found themselves easy prey for pirates and government reclamation. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">In the spirit of free commerce, the Consortium reinvented themselves as the Independent Core System Colonies and extended their reach past the core systems to offer support to any colony that wanted its freedom&mdash;and could afford to pay the CSC&rsquo;s protection fees. Because the ICSC is outside of any governmental jurisdiction, individual planets set up their own rules. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Several large banks and credit companies have settled here, providing security and bonds for corporations whose shady dealings might otherwise have their accounts frozen for government investigation.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The ICSC is run by the Central Space Consortium, a board of directors representing each major corporation and one director representing the member colonies outside of the core systems. The director&rsquo;s office sends a representative (<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"SpQZ6Q5xpoKWdd1G\">MARTIN</a>) to tour the independent colonies, getting a feel for what those lone worlds need from the alliance, as well as what they can supply in return.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The ICSC is clustered in the Core, in one of the richest resource-filled areas of the known galaxy&mdash;New Eden Sector. Key systems here include Volcus, Ventix, Grendel, and the colonies of Alexandria, Exeter, and St. John.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Both the 3WE and the UA have imposed trade sanctions and severe import and export taxes on the ICSC. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A major USCMC base is located just outside the ICSC&mdash;in part to keep a watchful eye on the independent systems, but also because Weyland-Yutani wants the Colonial Marines close in case of an invasion of the ICSC by the UPP. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Even though they are separate from the major governments, the Consortium has contracts in place to use national military forces for added protection. Outside the Core, the ICSC services, protects, and trades with a smattering of independent worlds in the Outer Rim and on the Frontier, including the Solomons and Anchorpoint Station.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y</span></h1>\n<p>The ICSC operates a combined security fleet of mercenary operatives from each of the corporate members. As can be guessed, while they are deadly when operating in small units, they are disastrous at fleet maneuvers and coordinated defenses simply because they do not possess the same training or follow the same rules of engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T&nbsp; A C T I V I T I E S</span></h1>\n<p>While corporations are cutthroat out in &ldquo;the real world,&rdquo; they are forced to play nice with each other within the boundaries of the ICSC. Together they operate a massive smuggling ring and black market operation.</p>\n<p>Opportunities abound for starship crews willing to do a quiet run from New Eden to the Frontier and back. Because of this, ICC agents and Colonial Marshals have their hands full policing the sector&rsquo;s imports and exports. The Consortium has also been covertly sending recruiters to successful colonies in an attempt to convince them to leave their government and join the ICSC.</p>\n<p>This practice is illegal and Colonial Administration is monitoring the situation closely.</p>\n<p>The Interstellar Commerce Commission is an organization designed to monitor and conduct interstellar trade. They enforce shipping restrictions and biological and chemical quarantine procedures for Earth and all other colonies with a population of 200,000 or more.</p>\n<p>In addition to performing spacedock inspections, the ICC can randomly detain, seize, and search cargo and personal craft for suspected contraband.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"}

Together they define the ALIEN universe. On their own, they define key aspects that the ALIEN movies and this game explore in detail. Use them to paint your ALIEN universe in the shade you want and highlight the elements you and your players find most exciting. Moreover, each key theme has a number of sub-themes that emphasize important parts of the ALIEN universe.</p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SPACE HORROR</h1>\n<p>At its core, ALIEN is about survival. It is about confronting your deepest fears, fighting them and trying to get home in one piece. It is about horror. The iconic Xenomorph is the ultimate manifestation of this aspect, but the universe is capable of creating horror in lots of different ways and not all are alien in nature. Unethical corporate experiments, bloody conflicts, and violent natural disasters make living in 2183 a tough proposition. The original <em>Alien</em> movie from 1979 is the perfect example of a space horror story. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SPACE IS HELL:</strong> Nature is neither good nor evil. It is, however, indifferent to humanity. The universe is a harsh place to live in and will kill you in the blink of an eye if given a chance. A routine space walk, a sudden solar flare, or an ice storm can go from something serene or even beautiful to life-threatening in a second. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">KILLING GREED:</strong> ALIEN focuses on blue-collar workers at the bottom of the economic ladder. The ordinary working men and women struggling to get by in a brutal, hyper-capitalistic society are the real heroes of the stories. It&rsquo;s working class sci-fi, where your sympathies are meant to be given to the little people. The greedy corporations and power hungry nations are the dragons which the PCs will have to face, sooner or later. In the end, humans are often the biggest monsters.</p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SCI-FI ACTION</h1>\n<p>Big set pieces, powerful weapons, and frenzied combat scenes. Action is a powerful driver in the ALIEN universe, whether it comes in the form of the colonial marines sweeping a seemingly abandoned mine only to discover something lurking in the dark, mighty starships exchanging missile volleys in high orbit, or corporate agents infiltrating an enemy installation. Heart-pounding action is a core element in the ALIEN roleplaying game. James Cameron&rsquo;s <em>Aliens</em> from 1986 is the seminal action movie in the series. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">SOMEONE ELSE&rsquo;S WAR:</strong> The conflicts and wars of the 22nd century are all about the big corps or big nations wanting to get bigger. They are about power and money for the ones that already have too much. The little people are the ones actually doing the fighting and you can be damn sure that the war is not really about their needs. Soldiers, marines, and grunts are all working for the Man. They fight because they need the paycheck to survive, not for some idealistic cause. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">EXPENDABLE ASSETS:</strong> Being a soldier in 2183 is being a very small cog in a very big machine. A soldier is entirely expendable. There is no shortage of poor young men and women that are willing to fill the ranks. Serving in the military means being at the mercy of the top brass and their corporate overlords. Human life is not a valuable commodity, better get used to it.</p>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SENSE OF WONDER</h1>\n<p>The ALIEN universe is a place of long-lost secrets and ancient mysteries. Faraway colonists report strange findings, spaceship crews on the Frontier discover inexplicable signals and encounter things that defy classification. There is clearly more to the universe than previously thought. The realization that the universe is not an empty place is an important aspect of ALIEN stories. The first act of the original <em>Alien</em> movie by Ridley Scott is about finding the unthinkable. A similar theme is present in <em>Prometheus</em>. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE ORIGIN OF LIFE:</strong> Where do we come from, who made us, what are we here for? These questions are as old as humanity itself. Nevertheless, these existential thoughts are made all the more relevant once humans encounter life amongst the stars. Birth, death, and the cycle of life is an important theme of many stories in ALIEN. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">OLD AND NEW GODS:</strong> With science struggling to answer the question of alien life and our role in the universe, religion answers the call. When humanity stares into the dark abyss of space and sees death and horror, many turn back towards faith and worship.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>RETRO FUTURISM</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">The future is old and worn. Spaceships look like oil refineries, computers are the size of a room, space suits look like they belong to 19th Century divers. <br />Everything in the ALIEN universe is designed for practicality and durability. <br />The retro futuristic aesthetic is everywhere, with the possible exception of the dwellings of the corporate elite. This particular brand of retro futurism is the result of Ron Cobb, Ridley Scott, and others who designed the original Alien movie. <br />Use this to describe the universe of ALIEN to the players. Describe old flickering CRT screens, analogue gear, and chunky equipment. Imagine a science fiction world with technology from the 1970&rsquo;s, leaky pipes, and bad lightning and you&rsquo;re on point.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}

An economic and political giant in both the Sol system and throughout the offworld colonies, the military might of the UA is unparalleled.</span> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">H I S T O R Y</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> Created to counter the financial and political might of the newly formed Three World Empire, The United Americas emerged in 2104 as a union of the nations of North, Central, and South America into one socioeconomic block. This alliance allowed the Americas to catch up to the 3WE and become pioneers of space travel and extrasolar colonies in their own right. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The Washington Treaty played a pivotal role in the merger, defining the member states&rsquo; responsibilities to the union and outlining provisions for military action performed under the flag of the United Americas. The United States of America stood at the forefront of the newly formed nation, its preexisting scientific and military industrial complex paving the way for the United States Colonial Marine Corps to become humanity&rsquo;s premiere peacekeeping force throughout the colonies.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> When the United Americas was formed, there were already several off-world colonies settled by its member states before the union&mdash;and not all of these worlds were happy to be part of this new, all-encompassing government. Torin Prime was one of them. Refusing to acknowledge the authority of the UA, a terrorist rebel faction calling themselves the J&rsquo;Har seized the colony, murdered planetside officials, and killed or imprisoned anyone not loyal to their cause. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Fearful that other colonies would follow suite, the UA was left with no choice but to make an example of Torin Prime. As the J&rsquo;Har rounded up more than half the population and interred them in concentration camps, the newly formed United Americas Allied Command (UAAC) worked with counter insurgents planetside to retake the world. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When the J&rsquo;Har managed to gain control of a flotilla of warships, the Outer Rim Defense Fleet responded in kind. The civil war escalated into a larger space war and took two years to resolve, but in the process the UA cemented their standing as a powerful nation amongst the stars.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">L E A D E R S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The United Americas is essentially an extension of the government of the United States of America, and as such is run by a President, Vice President, and a Congress representing all member signatories. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">On the Frontier, any encounter with UA leadership is likely to be with a Colonial Marshal, a bureaucrat from Colonial Administration, or a commander of the Colonial Marines.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">L O C A T I O N S</span> </span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> As the nations that later became the 3WE pioneered humanity's expansion into the core systems and Outer Veil, most of the colonies of the United Americas occupy a vast area of the Outer Rim Territories called the American Arm. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The UA Allied Command operates military bases and stations throughout all the territories and additional colonies are laced along the Frontier. Key worlds include Bracken&rsquo;s World, Terraform 3, Morning Glory, and the Crestus Garrison Systems.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\">R E L A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> The United Americas and the Union of Progressive Peoples (UPP) have been in a state of cold war for decades. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While the Colonial Marines are in place to keep the peace for the colonies of the American Arm, contracts and treaties with the 3WE and the Independent Core System Colonies mean that they are also obligated to protect their worlds as well. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While the USCMC is not controlled by Weyland-Yutani, the company&rsquo;s business holdings with the United Americas Allied Command means that the Colonial Marines can be called upon to provide security to W-Y assets at any time&mdash;a fact that doesn't sit well with many a platoon commander.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">M I L I T A R Y AND O R G A N I Z A T I O N S</span></h1>\n<h3><strong>UNITED AMERICAS ALLIED COMMAND:</strong></h3>\n<p>The UAAC is the joint command of military forces of all members of the United Americas. It is comprised of the United States Colonial Marine Corps (USCMC), the Canadian Colonial Armed Forces (CCAF), the Latin American Colonial Navy (LACN), The United States AeroSpace Force (USASF), and the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet (UAORDF). Headed by the Secretary of Defense, the allied command is a think tank of high level admirals and generals who devise strategy for, and coordinate, all major combat operations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>THE UNITED STATES COLONIAL MARINE CORPS:</strong></h3>\n<p>Founded before the United Americas merger, the primary focus of the USCMC is to maintain the security of all UA member states and extrasolar colonies. The USCMC spearheads all military campaigns undertaken by the United Americas Allied Command. They maintain several bases across the territories and are stationed at all UA garrisons, placing them within striking distance of nearly any hot spot.</p>\n<p>While they often operate in tandem with the Aerospace Force and Outer Rim Defense Fleet, they operate their own fleet of frigates and troop transports. At a constant state of readiness, the USCMC has the technology and training to deploy troops at a moment&rsquo;s notice and operate an independent unit for extended periods in hostile environments without any support.</p>\n<p>Throughout the eight decades since its inception, the USCMC has engaged in armed conflicts on nearly thirty extrasolar worlds. They have fought rogue nations and rebel colonies, as well as faced off against foreign powers in border and resource disputes. They have provided humanitarian aid in natural disasters, protected civilians in terrorist and hostage crises, and secured colonies from hostile lifeforms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong> COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION:</strong></h3>\n<p>This UA division was formed to protect the rights of all off-world colonists. CA supports and monitors all UA extrasolar colonies and stations and makes sure that supply chains flow as intended, vaccines are distributed, and that a semblance of order is maintained. For decades they have fought to have a minimum wage established for colonists, only to have their efforts blocked by corporate lobbyists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>COLONIAL MARSHAL BUREAU: </strong></h3>\n<p>The law enforcement arm of the Colonial Administration is the Colonial Marshal Bureau, which maintains police offices throughout the colonies and works with the Interstellar Commerce Commission to prevent the import or export of dangerous biologicals and chemicals. All major Marshal offices have an Interstellar Commerce Commission (ICC) agent attached to them. The Marshals also often work in conjunction with UA Federal agencies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">C U R R E N T&nbsp; A C T I V I T I E S</span></h1>\n<p>The United Americas has engaged in increased border conflicts with the UPP over disputed worlds. Recently, several USCMC units have gone missing, causing the UA to launch a full investigation.</p>\n<p>Colonel <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"K87uVtYpWn0MOIkk\">AERON PERCIVAL</a>&rsquo;s recon battalion has found growing evidence that Weyland-Yutani may be directly responsible for the loss of Hadley&rsquo;s Hope on LV-426&mdash;a colony under the joint jurisdiction of Colonial Administration and the company.</p>\n<p>If relations deteriorate further between the UA and W-Y, the 3WE could be dragged into the conflict, and that could mean war.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"}

{"_id":"yP8mCwXVolWLjpWi","name":"CAMPAIGN PLAY","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"camsymbol\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; There is more to the ALIEN universe than meets the eye. <br /><br />The movies, books, and comics barely scratched the surface. You and your players can go deeper than that in Campaign play. This game mode is meant to be played for a longer period of time, at least 5&ndash;6 game sessions and often much more than that. In Campaign play the PCs can roam the star map, take jobs and go on adventures, all while discovering long lost secrets, scheming with different factions and fighting to stay alive.</p>\n<table class=\"ntable\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">SESSION ZERO</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"trhead\">\n<h1 class=\"headng\">GOALS AND REWARDS</h1>\n</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"tr2\">\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">We recommend that you begin your campaign with a session where you as a group create your characters together and decide on which campaign framework you want to play &mdash; Space Truckers, Colonial Marines, or Frontier Colonists <br />(see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"A2mwXsJf0DLHyiHq\">THE CAMPAIGN FRAMEWORK</a>). <br />A big part of this session will be discussion amongst the players and you, the GM. <br /><br />Below are some recommended questions to go through and answer together.\n<ul>\n<li>How did you meet and how long have you been working together?</li>\n<li>Who are your buddies and who are your rivals?</li>\n<li>What do you do, and why do you do it?</li>\n<li>Do you have a spaceship?

Why are the PCs doing what they do and what are they working towards? The answers to these two questions are important, because they provide the main motivation for the PCs to go out and explore the universe of ALIEN. <br /><br />Maybe they are a crew of space truckers, plying the lanes on the Frontier, taking any job they can so that they can afford to lease their own ship. Or why not a group of Colonial Marshals out to get revenge on a criminal syndicate that killed their colleagues? Another option is a group of enlisted marines, on a tour of duty to be able to afford a cheap room on Anchorpoint station.Goals might change, and probably will. But it is important that the players know what their PCs are working towards. Remember, treat the PCs as real people with real dreams. <br /><br /></td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>CAMPAIGN FOCUS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">When starting a new campaign, give some thought to what themes you want to place the most importance in. Give the campaign a focus, something that you will build the plot around. A simple sentence or even just a word will do. Remember it when you create plots and antagonists for the PCs.

For a lot of groups, this can simply be their spaceship, which functions as a sort of home away from home. But it makes sense to have a real physical place where they can make connections, get job offers, and relax between missions. <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"bN8HxDrptT1DC4mi\">NOVGOROD STATION</a> is included in this book for this purpose.

Because of this, the PCs typically start with a spaceship. When between jobs, put the star map on the table and let them know what destinations they have to choose from with the current job offers. There are no right or wrong answers here, no rails to follow. Use the star system and planet generator in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"q7NeydrjWvrxkti0\">CREATING STAR SYSTEMS</a> to generate details of the destination.

That means that it is the players themselves who decide where they want to go, what jobs they want to take and how they will get there. To be able to do that they have to take jobs and earn money. A job can be anything from a simple pick up and drop off contract, to a complicated asset extraction in a covert corporate base. <br /><br />In <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"kHREQ8PDOjenrbLh\">JOB GENERATOR</a> you will find tables for generating jobs for the three core campaign frameworks: Space Truckers, Colonial Marines, and Frontier Colonists. We recommend that you always have 2&ndash;3 jobs generated, so that you can quickly provide the players with options once they finish their current assignment. Present the different jobs to the players, tell them what destinations they have and let them choose which one they want to take on. Let the players decide what they want to do, then work with that to create a fun adventure. <br />When creating a job, you choose or roll a number of complications and a plot twist. Use this to create the opposition for the job. <br />You can find stats for typical NPCs in <br /><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"3m7Pm1L9Ut255uMa\">SAMPLE NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS</a> <br />and information about Xenomorphs and other critters in the Alien Species section.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 class=\"headng\">XENOMORPHS IN CAMPAIGN PLAY</h1>\n<p>A distinct difference between Campaign and Cinematic play is the role of the Xenomorph. In Cinematic play, you want to provide the full ALIEN experience in a compact and accessible package and the Xenomorph is most often a part of this. In Campaign play, on the other hand, you will roam the star lanes of known space and take your time doing it. It would not make any sense to encounter a lethal alien during every job the PCs take on. Instead, make the most of other enemies: corporate agents, enemy soldiers, assassins, rival crews, rogue androids, critters, and so on. <br /><br />Save the Xenomorph for special occasions.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>READING LIST</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">To get inspiration and dive deeper into the ALIEN universe we recommend that you check out these fine publications: <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Alien: The Cold Forge by Alex White.</strong> An excellent standalone novel about the secret program to weaponize the Xenomorph. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Aliens: Bug Hunt by Scott Siegler and others.</strong> A collection of short stories focusing on violent encounters with critters and creatures. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Out of the Shadows, River of Pain, Sea of Sorrows.</strong> Three novels also available as audio dramas with exceptional production values. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">Aliens: Dead Orbit by James Stokoe.</strong> Atmospheric comic that would make an excellent Cinematic scenario. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">The Weyland-Yutani Report by S.D.

Cinematic play is the game mode used to emulate such stories, creating short, focused, and intense movie-like experiences that the PCs will be lucky to survive.Cinematic play takes some work on the GM&rsquo;s part&mdash;you need to read the scenario, and prepare handouts, maps, and characters. The payoff, however, will be great. Because most of the workload is on the GM and not the players, Cinematic play is ideal for beginners and introducing someone to the world of roleplaying games. It is also ideally suited for convention play and single evening events as these kinds of scenarios can often be played from beginning to end in a single session. We recommend that you play a Cinematic scenario before you dive into the Campaign game.Cinematic scenarios come with a set of pre-generated characters. Think of these as the roles in a written script. As they are tailor-made for the particular scenario, you can make sure that their backgrounds and agendas fit together with the plot of the scenario.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\"><strong>AGENDAS &amp; STORY POINTS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #ad9f9f;\">At the end of each Act, you should determine whether or not each player followed their PC&rsquo;s Personal Agenda.

We recommend this as your first major Cinematic game, and it introduces the concept very well. For a quick taste of the Cinematic experience, you can try out the mini-scenario Hope's Last Day. Going forward, many more Cinematic scenarios will be published, but you might also want to write your own. This way, you can be both the script writer and director of your very own ALIEN movie and let your friends star in it. <br /><br />This is how to structure a Cinematic scenario: <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE PROLOGUE:</strong> Introduction for the players, to be read aloud by the GM. Sets the stage for the scenario and makes sure that the players know enough to get going. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE SITUATION:</strong> What&rsquo;s really going on. The purpose here is to provide the GM with a concise overview of what is happening behind the scenes of the scenario. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">THE CHARACTERS:</strong> The PCs and the NPCs in the scenario. Each with stats and background. Each PC has a Personal Agenda for each of the three Acts of the scenario.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\"><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">LOCATIONS:</strong> Cinematic scenarios are generally location-based. Each scenario includes a detailed map of the core scenario area (or areas), with the key locations marked and described. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">ACTS &amp; EVENTS:</strong> A Cinematic scenario is divided into three Acts, each described briefly according to the following structure:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ACT1: THE SETUP.</strong> PCs and NPCs are introduced, conflicts are established.</li>\n<li><strong>ACT 2: THE TILT.</strong> Something unexpected happens, raising the stakes and the level of danger. Secrets are revealed.</li>\n<li><strong>ACT 3: THE SHOWDOWN.</strong> The story comes to a climactic resolution, depending on the actions of the PCs.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />Each Act has a number of possible Events. Some of these Events could be mandatory, but most should be optional, used or not used depending on the actions taken by the PCs. These Events should also generally be stand-alone, not connected in a predetermined narrative. Some Events affect all PCs, others are aimed at specific individuals. Some Events can even change a PC&rsquo;s Personal Agenda. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color: deepskyblue;\">EPILOGUE:</strong> A suggested sign-off message by one of the PCs, assuming anyone is still alive. The player of this PC can read the message aloud, or adapt it according to what happened in the scenario.</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td class=\"tcol1\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"}
