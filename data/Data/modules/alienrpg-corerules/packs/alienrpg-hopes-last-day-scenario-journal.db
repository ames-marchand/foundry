Established in 2157, the colony is a terraforming, research, and mining facility, and a new home to its pioneers. <br /><br />By 2179 there are 158 colonists there, and the first natives of LV-426 had been born. The giant processors are changing the atmosphere: now breathable, but still choked by dense clouds and wracked by electrical storms. The sky is always gloomy, more like night than day. Even when the sun is above the horizon it’s often hidden behind the giant form of Calpamos, LV-426’s parent planet. <br /><br />Some said building the colony was unwise. The moon hadn’t even been mapped in 2157, the weather would make life a constant struggle, and the violent geology made it feel as if the world didn’t want anyone there at all. Yet someone at Weyland-Yutani allocated the budget and gave the green light, and so Hadley’s Hope was founded. <br /><br />Supervisor Al Simpson got stuck into the job and the colonists soon learned to live with LV-426’s quirks. It wasn’t long before they were making a success of this most unlikely of colonies.Hope's Last Day tells the story of the final hours of Hadley’s Hope, all through the eyes of five colonist workers. It offers a brief taste of Cinematic gameplay and drops the players straight into the action. <br /><br />The pre-generated characters all have their own Agendas, Buddies, and Rivals, but together they have one desperate collective mission: to escape LV-426 alive. This short scenario encompasses what would normally be the third and final Act of a three-Act Cinematic scenario, and can be played in less than two hours. It is designed to give you a brief taste of Cinematic gameplay—for the full Cinematic experience, see the full-length Chariot of the Gods scenario by Andrew E.C. Gaska, published separately. <br /><br />More Cinematic scenarios will be published soon. <br /><br />Begin play by having your players choose their characters (or select them randomly) and read the intro text “<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-hopes-last-day-scenario-journal\" data-id=\"blDrDrH1vkEKVjlf\">What's the Story Mother?</a>” to them.</p>\n<br /><br /></div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CnrW4G4ZnTHuAkok":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-hopes-last-day-scenario.QeYBp9wHCS3RJN1U"}}}

KICKING OFF THE ACTION","content":"<div class=\"alienrpg a.entity-link\">\n<p>As the scenario starts, the team staggers into the West Airlock (see Locations, below), weary from their long walk. <br /><br />The PCs hear a distant voice talking over the intercom. It’s obscured by static but they can make out the following: <br /><br /><em> “This is an emergency message. <br />All colonists must immediately assemble at the main storeroom on the sub-level for safety.” </em><br /><br />After several repeats, the message cuts off with an electronic screech, and the PCs get no response if they try the intercom. <br /><br />In that deadened silence they hear a gunshot and a lonesome scream that echoes through the ventilation ducts: it could have come from anywhere (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>). Anyone who could really help—the colony’ research team, security detail, Supervisor Simpson and the rest of the administration—are nowhere to be found. <br /><br />Something is seriously wrong, and it’s time to start planning how to get the hell out of Dodge. <br /><br />The players should be thinking about finding Company Agent Reynolds or Dr. Komiskey and their keycards, and they know where they are likely to be found: the offices on blocks C2 and E2. <br /><br />Let the players explore the base freely, but feel free to nudge them toward Reynolds and Komiskey if they seem lost. <br /><br />The game starts out in stealth mode. Several <strong>PASSIVE</strong> Xeno­morphs are hiding in the base—see below.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<table class=\"ntable\"><caption style=\"color:#ad9f9f\"><strong>HIDDEN XENOMORPHS</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:#ad9f9f\">A number of type XX121 Xeno­morphs (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"oCw6dQGMiiemNmlm\">THE XENO­MORPHS</a>) are hiding in various locations when the scenario starts.

The remains of a partly dissected Facehugger lie pinned to a board. <br />A half-eaten doughnut sits on a desk. <br />In one sealed cabinet there are three alien eggs. <br />They look, and are, alive (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"oCw6dQGMiiemNmlm\">THE XENO­MORPHS</a>). There are various medical containers and equipment bags lying about that could be used to carry an egg. The cabinet can easily be broken open (only two points of damage needed). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">E2 – COMMAND, MEDICAL, MORGUE: </strong><br />The Command Center takes up the upper floor of E Block. <br /><br />It consists of the Command Room (known as Ops), Assistant Operations Manager Lydecker’s office, the medlab and the morgue. <br /><br /><strong>The Medlab</strong> consists of an examination room and the quarantine booth (that is locked from the outside but has a viewing window and intercom). The place is in shambles, empty cabinets flung open and over-turned in the mad scramble for medical supplies.<br /><br />Dr. Komiskey (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@Actor[Theodora Komiskey]</span> ) is trapped in the quarantine room, automatically sealed when the base went into lockdown. Along with Komiskey in the quarantine room the PCs can see the dead body of a man on an examination table, a specimen tube with a live Facehugger (counts as one inventory item), and a dead Facehugger on the floor.<br /><br />Dr. Komiskey is leaning against the viewing window, old tear tracks on her cheeks.<br />She has woken up after having been facehugged and knows she is doomed.<br />She has just given the man on the table a massive overdose to kill him, as he’s been facehugged as well, but can’t summon the courage to kill herself.<br />She is in shock, and pleads with the PCs to release her.<br />After much sobbing, she will agree to help them escape in the shuttle. She has the keycard on a lanyard around her neck.<br /><br />Calming down, Komiskey rambles on about how Reynolds intercepted a transmission from some corporate exec on Earth and decided to elbow in on the potential find. <br />She assembled her inspection team off the books and came here. If the PCs ask about the man on the table, she will tell them that he (Michael Drapers) is dead. She killed him to spare him a terrible fate. <br /><br />She won’t volunteer the fact that she has been facehugged, but if they make a successful <strong>MANIPULATION</strong> roll against her, she will admit it (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong> to all who hear that).<br /><br />The door to the quarantine room cannot be opened from the inside. <br />The PCs can open it with a <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll. <br />If they fail, they can break it down, but it has Armor Rating 6 and requires twelve points of damage to be breached—a sure way to alert the Drone one floor down. <br /><br />If the PCs release Dr. Komiskey, the Chestburster in her can be birthed later (see <span class=\"arpglink\">@JournalEntry[05. EVENTS]</span>). <br />She will also show the PCs the hyper-coolant spray canisters her team has been using to keep eggs in a dormant state for transport (keeps an egg dormant for D6 Turns).<br /><br />Ops is the nerve center of the colony, monitoring vital functions and security. <br />It’s usually busy but right now it’s unmanned. <br />The intercom hisses static, a screen flickers. <br />The CCTV system is damaged, but a successful <strong>COMTECH</strong> roll gives access to a few cameras. Flicking through, the PCs see scenes of carnage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A view of the carnage in the Sublevel Areas—see the text to the right (+1 <strong>Stress Level</strong>).</li>\n<li>A deserted corridor. In the distance, there’s movement. Zooming in, you catch sight of the bloodied remains of a person being dragged slowly out of view (Block A1, Offices).</li>\n<li>Movement on another camera, one showing Block E1, South Lock. The PCs get their first real view of a Drone Xeno­morph—right below them!

Despite this, the colony has been developing well. There’s opportunity aplenty—and risk aplenty, too. <br /><br />Four days ago, a wildcatter named Russ Jorden was brought back, infected with something. He died, and some snake-like parasite disappeared into the guts of the base. Security has had no luck catching the thing, and somehow more people were infected. Rumor has it that some of them have died, and that there are more of these snake-things than Supervisor Simpson is admitting to. <br /><br />Simpson spoke over the intercoms, calling for calm. Crisis or not, you have a job to do. <br /><br />Twenty-four hours ago, you headed out on a maintenance run to Processor 9, happy to leave base until the crisis blows over. Ten kilometers out, Singleton’s tractor gave up the ghost. A nasty, mechanical crunch told you it wasn’t going any further. <br />Calls back to Hadley’s Hope got a cursory response: you were told to wait, and they’d get to your little problem when they had the time. <br /><br />While you waited, you got to talking about the crisis and the Weyland-Yutani corporate shuttle that arrived right before you left. The shuttle carried an inspection team led by company agent Miranda Reynolds and her chief scientist Theodora Komiskey. <br /><br />Sigg relayed something he’d overheard—a hushed conversation about the shuttle being quickly and quietly readied for departure. Reynolds and Komiskey are likely the only two who can authorize its use, and the only two with the access keycards needed to use it. <br /><br />For all you know, it was Reynolds who ordered Jorden out there in the first place. <br /><br />It’s not right for the Weyland-Yutani reps to just skip out and leave you—the workers—to clean up this bloody mess! <br />If things go bad, why shouldn’t you get those keycards and get away instead? <br /><br />A day has passed, and you’ve still heard nothing. All further attempts to contact Hadley’s Hope have been fruitless. <br /><br />No one is coming to help. The only communications you pick up on are garbled, panicked even. <br /><br />There’s no option but to walk back, and see what the hell is going on...</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CnrW4G4ZnTHuAkok":3,"M2aZuGY0mCdDk004":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-hopes-last-day-scenario.hR6mFXB6D5QscvrX"}}}

Instead, consider the events an arsenal of drama for you to use as you see fit. <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">A CRY FOR HELP:</strong> An intercom buzzer sounds close to the PCs, loud in the quiet, making them all jump. The colonist Wes Osterman is trapped in Billy’s Bar. He keeps buzzing until they answer and then he will beg for help. If they don’t answer, the noise will make any Xenos in their area <strong>ACTIVE</strong>. <br />Osterman has locked the door, but something is trying to get in. In the background they can hear the dull thump, thump, thump of something heavy battering the door to the bar. If they decide to help Wes, there is a Xeno Drone breaking in through the ground floor doors. It’s happy to find other, easier prey. <br />If the PCs wait too long to decide, they hear the door to the bar finally give way, along with the squeals of the Xeno and the screams of Osterman as he is taken away to the hive (+1 <strong>STRESS LEVEL</strong>). <br /><br /><strong style=\"color:deepskyblue\">THE BIRTH:</strong> If the PCs have rescued Dr. Komiskey from the Medlab or Maria Hemming from Tannen's Casino, the Chestbursters inside them will be born sooner or later (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"alienrpg-corerules.alienrpg-gmguide\" data-id=\"oCw6dQGMiiemNmlm\">THE XENO­MORPHS</a>).
