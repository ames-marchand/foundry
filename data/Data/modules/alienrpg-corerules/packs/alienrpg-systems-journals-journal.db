Eager to help in exchange for new tariff and export treaties, the United Americas sent in the marines. Because the Colonial Marines considered the rebel raids little more than a nuisance, the rebelling colonists were nicknamed “Bug-Boys.” <br />The situation changed when the Bug-Boys started using sophisticated weapons from an unidentified source—either a corporate or political enemy of the Three World Empire—and managed to cripple the USCMC frigate USS Sulaco with an orbital strike. The USCMC retaliated in kind, bringing in ships, marines, heavy equipment and tanks to retake the planet. The Bug-Boys were squashed, and the USCMC has maintained an occupying peace force on Linna 349 ever since, despite requests from the Three World Empire to release the world.

Temperatures vary widely as the world makes its orbit around the binary stars of Fiori 16a and b. Fury is home to a large variety of fish, as well as at least one group of primitive land animals. Unfortunately, the most prolific species on the planet is a small arthropod that is similar to lice, making it mandatory that all visitors shave their body hair. Fury 161’s year is only ten days long—and half of that year is in darkness. Determined to be rich in platinum, the planet was extensively mined for decades. Estimates proved to be optimistic, however, and Fury 161’s resources tapped out quickly. Never one to miss a beat, Weyland-Yutani converted the worksite to a Class C Work Correctional Unit and lead works for radioactive and toxic waste disposal, leasing it to the Three World Empire. While at its height the facility housed thousands of prisoners, it was closed in the 2170s—leaving only a custodial staff and less than two dozen inmates to keep the facility running.In 2179, an EEV pod from the errant starship Sulaco crash-landed on the planet, bringing some kind of contagion.

Morse also claims the company was at fault for the massacre.
