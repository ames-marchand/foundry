The second is more confusing. Contact was lost with the Seegson sponsored terraforming colony orbiting Gamma Leporis C in 2175.

While\r\nnew arrivals here scramble to alert the UPP SOF Command of any contact, old timers know the drill.\r\nZnoy Outpost is mostly underground, having been driven into the rock like a giant stake. During the day, the outpost unfurls a solar shield to both protect it from the direct heat and to harness the star’s rays and recharge its power cells. A “day” on\r\n17 Phei Phei E lasts nearly two Earth months while a “night” lasts about 28 Earth days. Supply ships can only approach when the outpost is on the nightside, as the planetoid itself shields the transports from the extreme heat of the sun.\r\nAssignment to Znoy is considered a punishment. \r\nIt is understaffed and ill-equipped to face even an unlikely invasion that might come through this area. While it is equipped with system-wide orbital nuclear arrays, the outpost itself has only two dropships and four heat-shielded tracked vehicles for surface operations. To make matters worse for the soldiers assigned there, Znoy is the closest UPP military installation to Zeta Reticuli, and the United Americas Allied Command is investigating the possibility that a UPP strike was launched there against Hadley’s Hope.

In 2122, the USCSS Nostromo touched down on LV-426 in response to an unknown distress call, allegedly encountering a hostile alien life form that eventually led to the ship’s destruction at the hands of one of the crew. However, when the moon was extensively surveyed in the 2130s, it was discovered that it had no indigenous life, calling the Nostromo rumors into question.\r\nLV-426 is perhaps best known as the site of the doomed colony Hadley’s Hope. Thirty-five years after the Nostromo incident, Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial dministration set up an atmospheric processor on the swiftly turning moon and began terraforming procedures. The moon was renamed Acheron by its early settlers, and Hadley’s Hope\r\nendured there for more than twenty years. The colony stopped transmitting reports in July of 2179, prompting a visit by a contingent of colonial marines. Whatever transpired next led to the nuclear annihilation of the colony and the death of\r\nboth the colonial marine unit and all 158 colonists.\r\nWhat caused the destruction is uncertain—conflicting reports range from an attack by a rival government or unknown alien species to a simple reactor accident and meltdown. All that remains is a radioactive wasteland stretching over 700 km.\r\nSoon after the incident, both Weyland-Yutani and the Colonial Marines sent search and rescue teams to Acheron in the hopes of finding survivors.\r\n\r\nWhile the colony and the atmospheric processor were vaporized, it was theoretically possible that any colonists who made it as far as the Ilium Range would be protected from the blast by the mountains there.
